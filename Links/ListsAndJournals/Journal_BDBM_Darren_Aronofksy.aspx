        New York – born, Darren Aronofksy, who did his film
        studies in the Harvard University, with his handful number of critically celebrated
        films, is one of the far-sighted directors, currently in the Hollywood film industry.
        His films, often are meticulously crafted, visually salient psychologically overt.
        There has also been a leisure and eventual growth of Aronofksy over the years, from
        films that are aberrantly dark and visceral, to films that carry more of his craftsmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Pi (1998)” was Aronofksy's first theatrical venture. Shot stylishly in bleached
        Black and White (with a very low budget), "Pi" was relentlessly challenging the
        audience with its mathematical, religious and psychological perceptions. "Pi" could
        have been a disaster. It totally relied on the new age audience. Fortunately, with
        its all techno directional brilliance, "Pi" saw a near-bleak view of the ornate
        world. "Pi" had resemblances to David Lynch's thrillers, especially, "Eraserhead".
        It was smart, dark and at times frightening. Darren Aronofksy's debut was ambitious
        and successful.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Requiem for a dream (2000)” released in 2000, was bleak and stomach churning.
        Aronofksy movies are intense and in "Requiem for a dream", he was at his peak. This
        junkie movie with its chaotic imagery and explosive screenplay portrays nightmarish
        visuals. With career best performance from the crew, especially Ellen Burstyn, the
        movie is very disturbing, more on the lines of Danny Boyle's startling "Trainspotting".
        It is packed with audacious sequences of nightmares and hallucinations, a perfect
        visual symphony for a chilling drug drama. The audience tend to get high, with an
        unsettling feeling of movie watching experience.
    </p>
    <p>
        The year 2006 saw from Aronofksy, what critics feel is his weakest film to date,. Although not as bad as it sounds, "The Fountain",
        was silently flawed, but brilliantly visualized. It is a movie, that is magnificent
        to look at and with whimsical romantic moments, just that it doesn’t make your heart
        ache. The movie spans across the universe's timeline (or rather the earth's timeline).
        Strains of the psychology, touches of philosophy, metaphysical rides add up to the
        movie's directional credits. But of all Aronofsky's movies, "The Fountain" is very
        much pretentious although admirable.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The Wrestler(2008)”,quite literally shut every critic's mouth up, with its
        sheer perfection. The alchemist was at the peak of his art. Leaving apart, all his
        psychological and metaphysical tones, Aronofksy, aptly directed "The Wrestler",
        an enormously gripping realistic drama, with a phenomenal performance from Mickey
        Rourke. It is one of the very best films of 2008 and arguably the best yet from
        Aronofksy. It is a deeply affecting portrait of a man's life, whose melancholy makes
        his life difficult. "The Wrestler" pretty much keeps, Aronofksy, along with the
        pioneering new generation directors. The movie is more of a character study and
        conveys the heartbreakingly realistic truth of life.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Black Swan (2010)” is the most rewarded of the Aronofksy's movies. Natalie
        Portman's performance for the film won the "Best Actress" award. "Black Swan" is
        immense, bold, surreal and slightly melodramatic. Aronofsky's delirious direction
        and genius filmmaking techniques make "Black Swan", one of the very few movies,
        that potentially drives a character, outside the circle it is bound to. With beautiful
        ballerina choreography and a few beguiling horror moments, make this psychological
        thriller, one of the best of the year. It is an unforgettable movie that is skilfully
        intense, compelling and lyrically poignant.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Noah (2014)", the adaptation of the biblical story, is a clean, hauntig work. But, not quite remarkable as 
        his other works. Boldly performed by Russell Crowe, the movie is visually splendid and 
        superbly crafted. While it had the potential to become a great movie, it just falls short. 
        Nevertheless, its often skillfully directed with philosophy and character seemlessly blending with each other

    </p>
    <p>
        Although nearly all his movies are restricted to psychological thrillers, Darren
        Aronofksy has a fine sense of film acumen, with which he can paint his visual flair
        in any of the genres.
        But, what we cannot refute is that Aronofksy is the man with relentless potential
        and his passion of the art, he is into.
