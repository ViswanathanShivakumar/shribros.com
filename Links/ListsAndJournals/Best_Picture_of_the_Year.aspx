    <h1>The Best Picture of the Year</h1>
    <ul class="List">

            <h2>2018 - SHOPLIFTERS</h2>
            <h3>HIROKAZU KOREEDA</h3>
            <h3>JAPANESE</h3>
               "Manbiki Kazoku" by Koreeda is a genuine masterful piece of work. The movie is naturally deep, yet subtly philosophical on screen; truly affecting and packs the punch not just with its plot points but with 
			   the sheer definition of what love is. Graceful, rich, poignant and ultimately efficient, Shoplifters is truly the best picture of the year.

            <h2>2017 - A GHOST STORY</h2>
            <h3>DAVID LOWERY</h3>
            <h3>ENGLISH</h3>
               
           Shot with mundane beauty and precise poignancy, in a stunning style, David Lowery's "A Ghost Story" is about loneliness;a meditative , imaginary piece of work, that does not
             care about the pace at which it moves, as it doesn't matter for the subject that it choses.
             Self-aware, yet not devoid of minor gimmicks, this original, scary trip and the scare wholly belongs to life and death , rather than the ghosts.
             Who could have thought a man with a king sized bed sheet on will make it to the best picture of the year?
             A Ghost Story is a winner.

            <h2>2016 - MANCHESTER BY THE SEA</h2>
            <h3>KENNETH LONERGAN</h3>
            <h3>ENGLISH</h3>
               
            Whilst there are many films, that get the protagonist deep in grief, there is none like, this year's best, Kenneth Lonergan's 
             "Manchester by the Sea", which is affectingly painful and heartbreaking, yet filled with vibrant delicate moments, 
             positioned effortlessly all over this beautiful film. Cassey Affleck's Lee Chandler is an imploding devastation, 
             played with impeccable temperament and heart. When the character (Lee) says, in a pivotal, intense moment, to the short,
              but explosively acted character, Randi played by Michelle Williams, "You don't understand. There is nothing there", 
             it perhaps forms the deepest and the most existential moment in the recent film memory and for all that, we consider it this film, 
             the year's best.

            <h2>2015 - DHEEPAN / COURT (TIE)</h2>
            <h3>JACQUES AUDIARD / CHAITANYA TAMHANE</h3>
            <h3>FRENCH / MARATHI</h3>
               
              Jacques Audiard's "Dheepan" is a film, that not many people can relate to with their own live and yet they would at many moments.
              It's a French film with most of its dialogues in Tamil; Very native, understated and surprising passionate, "Dheepan" has great charisma from the lead actors,alarming background score and superb
              cinematography. Although, flawed to its own good, "Dheepan"is intense, value driven,and along with "Court" is the best movie of the year.
              
              "Court" by Chaitanya Tamhane, is a great film; A film that will stand the test of time; it is a courtroom drama that often has the camera
              sitting outside the court. It is an observational drama, that is driven vividly by the clarity of director's vision. Heartachingly
              realistic, "Court" drills down the society in way that no film in India has ever done before.

            <h2>2014 - WINTER SLEEP</h2>
            <h3>NURI BILGE CEYLAN</h3>
            <h3>TURKISH</h3>
                    A Hotel owner, who once was an actor, in Anatolia, is married to a young lady. There is also the protagonists' sister who lives with them.
               "Winter Sleep" is about their relationships. Its about human behaviour and mindset.Unlike any movie this year, "Winter sleep" achieves in its fine poetical depth.
               Utterly beautiful, deliberately paced and rewarding for its length, Nuri Bilge Ceylan's "Winter Sleep" is an absorbing work of Anton Chekov
               characters.  "Winter Sleep" won the Palme D'r at Cannes, and we dont see any reason, why it shouldn't have.

            <h2>2013 - THE GREAT BEAUTY</h2>
            <h3>PAULO SORRENTINO</h3>
            <h3>ITALIAN</h3>
                    Paulo Sorrentino's "The Great Beauty" is a phenomenal and mesmerising experience. It is ambitious and spellbinding.The film itself is an exhaustive study of character , existentialism and an elusive satire on the high-class urban life. The poetic journey is sustained with some unique, fabulous music and is stupendously shot. The unforgettable film creeps into melancholy and the solitary beauty towards the finale, as Sorrentino confidently marches on with his masterstroke movie. "The Great Beauty" is the best film of the year.

            <h2>2012 - BEYOND THE HILLS</h2>
            <h3>CRISTIAN MUNGIU</h3>
            <h3>ROMANIAN</h3>
            "Dupa Dealuri" aka "Beyond the Hills", by Cristian Mungiu, is nothing short of a entrancing experience. It is scrumptiously raw and mightily emotional. Disturbing, multilayered, philosophical and towards the end, devastating. While, Mungiu keeps delivering masterpieces along the way and awards tend to overlook his creations, his "Beyond the Hills" is the best picture of the year.

            <h2>2011 - A SEPARATION / ONCE UPON A TIME IN ANATOLIA (TIE)</h2>
            <h3>ASGHAR FARHADI / NURI BILGE CEYLAN</h3>
            <h3>PERSIAN</h3>
            Farhadi's "A Separation" is a meditation of integrity and truth. 
      The film deftly handles a very complex, yet universal
      subject, with an unblemished script. The movie succeeds in several layers,
      even as a thriller and not many would deny us selecting "A Separation" as the best movie of the year.

               "Once Upon a Time in Anatolia" is an achievement. N B Ceylan's meditative effortless effort, offers the audience an atmospheric, beautiful
               and vivid film, that will linger in the mind for a very long time. Nothing short of brilliance, this movie ties up with "A Seperation"
               for the best film of the year.

            <h3>ENGLISH</h3>
           No other feature film , this year ,was as intricate/as heart warming/as perfect
        as the Pixar's yet another masterpiece "Toy Story 3". With not only stunning animation,
        but&nbsp; also with soulful, poignant moments, "Toy Story 3" remains the best live
        action or animation movie of 2010.

            <h3>JACQUES AUDIARD</h3>
            <h3>FRENCH</h3>
              Shot in an intricate style, a prison drama involving drugs, mafia, "The Prophet"
        does certainly deserve the runner up at Cannes. The film has visually stunning cinematography
        and performances.Yes, we feel its the best movie of the year.
