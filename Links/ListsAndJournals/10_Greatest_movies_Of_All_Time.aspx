            <h3>MARTIN SCORSESE</h3>
            Scorsese and De Niro have done quite a number of films together. But no other film is as great as the flawed human nature depiction in the "Raging Bull". The portrayal
        of each and every character at every instance stands out. De Niro performance as Jake LaMotta has never been matched yet.</li>

            <h3>STEVEN SPIELBERG</h3>

        as his best and close to his heart.This movie's portrayal of Schindler, Amon Goeth and the Polish Nazi camp is extra ordinary and spell binding.</li>

            <h2>8. Saving Private Ryan (1998)</h2>
            <h3>STEVEN SPIELBERG</h3>
            If there is one movie that clearly and precisely describes war as it is , it is "Saving Private Ryan". With exceptional cinematography and direction, the movie's
        opening scene is unmatched. Sure sets a benchmark for war movies and cinematography.</li>

            <h2>9. Father and Daughter (2001)</h2>
            <h3>Michael Dudok de Wit</h3>
            Michael Dudok de Wit' short, "Father and Daughter", is an unforgettable piece of art work. It reels for only 9 minutes totally, but spell bindingly engrosses the
        viewers to finish off with a heart wrenching finale. This short teaches movie makers on how a huge emotional impact can be created in viewers with just a few minutes
        of motion. On par with even the best live action movies that run for hours. </li>

            <h2>10. 4 luni, 3 saptamâni si 2 zile (2007)</h2>
            <h3>Cristian Mungiu</h3>
            Darkly riveting, Cristian Mungiu's " 4 months, 3 weeks and 2 days" , is an example of master film making. Rarely seen in any top lists, this Romanian film won the
        "Palme D'Or" at Cannes and had all the reasons to deserve it. Anamaria Marinca gives a glorious performance.&nbsp; A very simple story reaches heights with narration
        and direction.</li>
