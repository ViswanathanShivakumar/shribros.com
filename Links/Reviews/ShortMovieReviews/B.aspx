       <a name="Birdman"></a>
    <h2>Birdman | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu has a great filmography. With “Birdman” he adds up to his legacy of prodigious films. “Birdman” is stuffed with splendid performances and technical smartness. The one shot technique, while may seem a gimmickry, it really isn’t. Michael Keaton and Edward Norton, do their best in “Birdman” and the movie’s tone, captivatingly peels out every character, and majorly the protagonist. While, disputably not Inarritu’s best and remains typically award-driven-Hollywoodish, “Birdman” is a vital movie , with incredible cinematography, relevant music and first-rate performances.

    <h2>Boyhood | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Richard Linklater’s “Boyhood” is a remarkable achievement in cinema. Aptly named, its humungous scale lies in the observation of human condition. As in every other, Linklater’s movie, every actor hold the movie, with their powerhouse performance. A movie, that could’ve have been a usual coming-of-the-age drama, shifts itself into a trajectory that is so audacious and slow-burner. Profound and unusually experimental, the movie captures the turmoil of American childhood, vividly. “Boyhood” is one of the best movies this year, unarguably.

    <h2>Blue is the Warmest Color | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Blue is the warmest color” is a honest portrayal of coming-of-age modern love. 
        Defined by brilliant performances from its lead pair, Adèle Exarchopoulos and Léa Seydoux, the movie benefits from the epic direction of Abdel Kechiche. 
        Emotional, humanistic, multi-layered and patient, “Blue is the warmest color” engulfs the audience with its audacity and the intoxicating passion. 
        Kechiche’s movie on self-discovery is gratifying as it is intricate.

     <a name="Badlapur"></a>
    <h2>Badlapur | 2015
    </h2>
    <p>
        There are a lot of movies about revenge; and they come in different genres. Sriram Raghavan’s “Badlapur” is another revenge story about fate, love and hatred; It is about how things do matter and they do not. A tale well said, yet flawed, despite its actor’s towering performances, notably Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Varun Dhawan. Writing in the second act wanes a bit, but then the finale retains the hold. “Badlapur” is an sensitive film that succeeds at many levels, with its strong roots, yet stumbles unnoticeably for a period of its running time.

    <h2>Blue Jasmine | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine” is the result of his relentless appetite for great scripts and even headed direction. 
        Cate Blanchett performance as Jasmine is mesmerizing in this darkly funny and deeply touching drama. 
        Nervous breakdowns, rugged relationships, anxieties are all composed with a comprehensive examination. 
        Marginally unhinged, while witty and cautionary, “Blue Jasmine” is one of Woody Allen’s best recent efforts.

       <a name="Butler, The"></a>
    <h2>The Butler | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
       Lee Daniels’ “The Butler” follows Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker), an African American who serves at least eight presidents, as a butler in the White House. The film is melodramatic in comparison with Daniels’ previous superior work “Precious", but strongly holds ground with its story telling. With wonderful cast supporting him, Daniels smoothly drives the movie, although lethargically. “The Butler” is not as gritty as last year’s “Twelve Years a slave”, but lives well in its own world.

        <a name="Bangalore Days"></a>
    <h2>Bangalore Days| 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       Anjali Menon’s “Bangalore Days”, reminds us a lot of what a movie from Farhan Akthar could be. That is a compliment. Beginning with a note that we’ve relentlessly watched over decades in Indian cinema, “Bangalore Days” succeeds in the second and third act, quite naturally. With emotional resonance and a well-staged screenplay, “Bangalore Days” is worth a watch.

       <a name="Bank Dick, The"></a>
    <h2>Bank Dick, The| 1940
    </h2>
    <p>
W.C.Fields’ wits are matchless. In his “The Bank Dick” directed by Edward Cline, he plays Egbert Souse from the town of Lompoc, who is offered the job to direct a film in the town and what follows is utter fun and lunacy. With great one-liners and preposterously comical and witty gestures from W.C.Fields’, this 1940 comedy is cranky and marvelous. Falls a little short of his outstanding work in “The Gift”, “The Bank Dick” is still, quite a classic.

        <a name="Big Hero 6"></a>
    <h2>Big Hero 6| 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
Disney’s “Big Hero 6” falls between Pixar’s heartfelt, yet playful works and Dreamworks puerile, yet funny movies. Moving, charming and striking to look at, “Big Hero 6” starts fresh with its action and unconventional super hero, who is adorable as he is amusing.  Fun all the way,   wholly engaging and repeatedly touching, “Big Hero 6” is a superior effort.    </p>
