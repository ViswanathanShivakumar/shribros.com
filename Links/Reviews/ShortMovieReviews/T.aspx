    <h2>This is the End | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Evan Greenberg and Seth Rogen’s “This is the End” is delightful comedy movie, regardless of its wobbly script. It is often amusing with the self-depreciating performances from Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill and the company. While, it doesn’t go too far or deep in to any of the territories and not too offensive for its subject, “This is the End” tickles as it should. There are moments that could’ve been even more funnier, but then “This is the End”, doesn’t bother too much about whatsoever at all.
