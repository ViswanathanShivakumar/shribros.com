    <h2>The Tale of Princess Kaguya | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
Isao Takahata is a great man in his profession. He is the co-founder of Studio Ghibli, along with another giant, Hayao Miyazaki. His 2014 feature, “The Tale of Princess Kaguya” is a sad tale in a way. It’s slow burning screenplay sneaks in to us, under our skin, with its love, romance and admirable aspiration. It is so darn gorgeous, that you cannot take your eyes of the pastel smeared screen. “The Tale of Princess Kaguya” is an example of why, Japanese animation, still remains one of the finest. Heartbreakingly fantastic, this watercolor animation film, is no less than a gem.    </p>

    <h2>Tomorrowland| 2015
    </h2>
    <p>
All of Brad Bird’s ventures have been solid. They are all dazzling films, starting from “The Iron Giant” till his most recent “The Ghost Protocol” (Others are “Incredibles”, which lives up to its name and “Ratatouille”). He has the flair of entertaining the audience in a superior way. But, “Tomorrowland” is a disaster for a man of his competence. It is visually captivating, yet devoid of the soul; the soul that hoists good science fiction films to their greatness. Even with the huge charisma of George Clooney on screen and a nice turn by its lead, “Tomorrowland” never reaches the height that it ambitiously, strives to. It has its own moments, which doesn’t sum up together. It is more Disney-ish, only without its tenderness. “Tomorrowland” starts of encouraging and lets us down with its ever boring script.

    <h2>This is the End | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Evan Greenberg and Seth Rogen’s “This is the End” is delightful comedy movie, regardless of its wobbly script. It is often amusing with the self-depreciating performances from Seth Rogen, James Franco, Jonah Hill and the company. While, it doesn’t go too far or deep in to any of the territories and not too offensive for its subject, “This is the End” tickles as it should. There are moments that could’ve been even more funnier, but then “This is the End”, doesn’t bother too much about whatsoever at all.

    <h2>The Theory of Everything | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       James Marsh’s “The Theory of everything” is a biopic of the renowned astrophysicist Stephen Hawking; steered by a brilliant turn from Eddie Redmayne, the movie is elevated from the shallow treatment to a more watchable and often affecting film, that asides its manipulative writing, brings quite some insight into the genius’ life; and not to forget a superlative performance by Felicity Jones as Jane Wilde.

     <a name="Talented Mr. Ripley, The"></a>
    <h2>The Talented Mr. Ripley | 1999
    </h2>
    <p>
Anthony Minghella returned to direction after his Oscar winning “The English Patient” with 1999’s “The Talented Mr.Ripley”, with Matt Damon in the lead role as Tom Ripley and Jude Law (as Dickie Greenleaf). Gwyneth Paltrow (as Marge Sherwood) plays Dickie’s love interest. The movie is based on the 1955 novel of the same name by Patricia Highsmith. “The Talented Mr. Ripley” is a dark and unsettling film. While taking the benefits of the psychological background of the story, the movie plays with identity theft with lustrous settings and thrilling narrative. Trivial loopholes in the plot doesn’t let the script down, as there is much to look out with stealing performances from Matt Damon and Jude Law. A very fine movie by Anthony Minghella.
