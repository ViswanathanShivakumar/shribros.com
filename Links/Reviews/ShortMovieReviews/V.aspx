    <h2>Videodrome | 1983
    </h2>
    <p>
David Cronenberg’s “Videodrome” revolves around a television show of the same name. It is baffling, but is an audacious attempt that marks a pronounced social commentary, that would easier to assimilate now, than ever; Such futuristic visionary; “Videodrome” is grotesque in its own way and is not shocking to see David Cronenberg’s hallucinatory  and fascinating imagery. James Woods’ Max Renn is a symbolic character of obsession, in a movie that can be termed as a pyscho-fantasy-horror, but reflects only the disgusting reality.
