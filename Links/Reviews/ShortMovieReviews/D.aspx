    <a name="Dawn of the planet of the apes"></a>
    <h2>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       Once upon a time, “Planet of the apes” series was nothing much to talk about, after the first few movies. With the advent of the reboot, “Rise of the planet of the apes”, the whole thing changed. Its sequel, “Dawn of the planet of the apes”, roots the series to a deeper soil, with its terrific craft. Despite the fact that it not as inventive as the former, “Dawn” rests on the shoulders of godfather-ish Cesar, played with outright charisma by Andy Serkis and the iniquitous Koba, played by Toby Kebbell. Clever direction by Matt Reeves, and smart storytelling, makes “Dawn of the planet of the apes”, an outstanding entertainer and  a thriller, overriding the clichés and paving way for the next episode.

    <a name="Drug War"></a>
    <h2>Drug War | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Johnnie To’s “Drug War” is an intelligent, tense and well-constructed action thriller. With drugs as the center of the story, the movie unfolds in to a pattern of efficient and intelligently plotted story telling. With a violent and action packed finale, “Drug War” is a fine film by the Hong Kong action master.

     <a name="Dictator, The"></a>
    <h2>Dictator, The | 2012
    </h2>
    <p>
Another provocative, offensive, yet funny movie from Larry Charles and Sacha Baron Cohen; while the latter has even more guts to repeat himself being crude and inventive, “The Dictator”, suffers a bit from uneven gags and repetitive satire. But, it might be unfair to call it a bad movie, because it is not; it gets powerful and disturbing, even with its senseless fun. Sacha Baron Cohen is truly a talented comedian and “The Dictator” majorly stands on his shoulders; but be very warned, as his other films with Larry Charles (the singular piece, Borat and the very funny , Bruno).

     <a name="Dil Dhadakne Do"></a>
    <h2>Dil Dhadakne Do | 2015
    </h2>
    <p>
“Dil Dhadakne Do” is Zoya Akthar’s directorial follow up to her delightful, complex, “All About Eve”-like “Luck By Chance” and the ever entertaining, “Dil Chahta Hai” –like “Zindagi Milege Na Dobara”. While, “Dil Dhadkne Do” can be imagined, loosely forming the middle part of the road (sea) trilogy, following “ZMND”, it is also muddled, chaotic and also entertaining. While never losing grip over the characters, the film drives itself well; unfortunately these are not fresh characters, but characters that have been in cinema for years; While, there are gorgeous, jokey and emotionally poised moments, the film definitely reminds us of all her and her brother’s movies, that he either produced or directed. Rewarding, yet unsatisfying, “Dil Dhadakne Do” is a reasonable watch.

     <a name="Death Proof"></a>
    <h2>Death Proof| 2007
    </h2>
    <p>
“Death Proof” is a proof of how significant can be a script and dialogue, to pleasantly drive a slasher movie, with A-grade interest. Quentin Tarantino’s love for the exploitation movies, contrasted with his artful suspense and pranks, in essence, provides “Death proof”, a smart proportion of grindhouse entertainment; It is a fabulously made film, even relative to the upscale filmography of the director. Gory, ruthless, funny and replete with the director’s brand dialogues, “Death Proof” is quite an unappreciated, yet thoroughly well-controlled film, which deserves better consideration. 

    </p>
     <a name="Deconstructing Harry"></a>
    <h2>Deconstructing Harry| 1997
    </h2>
    <p>
“Deconstructing Harry” is as solid as any of Woody Allen’s shrewd works; and most of his films are. With an inspiration from Ingmar Bergman’s “Wild Strawberries” on the plot, Woody Allen’s film is a characteristic comedy that is studded with verbose action that gets even nastier with the protagonist being a sex obsessed writer. Bitter, yet amusing, Harry’s hostile character, drives himself through his life with numerous wives, lovers and self-absorbed character. “Deconstructing Harry” might be a typical page from the text book by the director, but is definitely a book that can be penned only by Woody Allen.

    </p>
     <a name="Dallas Buyers Club"></a>
    <h2>Dallas Buyers Club | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
       “Dallas Buyers Club” is completely an actor’s film that rests itself on the tremendously inspiring performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Based on the true life story of the AIDS diagnosed cowboy Ron Woodruf, the movie is uplifting and character driven. Jean-Marc Vallée’s crisp direction and very good supporting performances make Dallas Buyers Club a remarkable movie.
    </p>
       <a name="Deep Impact"></a>
    <h2>Deep Impact | 1998
    </h2>
    <p>
       “Deep Impact” could’ve been a very good disaster movie. Nevertheless, it is safely not a bad movie. At the end, it is emotive, visually good and very Hollywoodish, “Deep Impact” is not a dull film. But it could’ve got more wits and courage. Tea Loni is just fine as Jenny Lerner as so is Robert Duvall and Elijah Wood in their particular roles.  “Deep Impact”, definitely is better and reasonable than its same year counterpart, “Armageddon” on the same subject.

     <a name="Don't Look Now"></a>
    <h2>Don't Look Now | 1973
    </h2>
    <p>
Part psychological drama, part thriller, “Don’t Look Now”, is an accomplishment on par with “Rosemary’s Mary” as far as these kind of movies go. Acted with great ingenuity by the leads, Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, it’s an outing that will, near the finish, send chill down our spine. The color of red and the subsequent metaphors in the movie can be vastly disconcerting. Striking, gripping and superior in its making, Nicolas Roeg’s “Don’t Look Now” acts also as an inventive and powerful drama.

    </p>
        <a name="Dial M For Murder"></a>
    <h2>Dial M For Murder | 1954
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alfred Hitchcock’s “Dial M for Murder” is exactly what you’d come to expect of him. Completely suspenseful, immediately electrifying and cunningly witty. With a sinister role by Ray Miland, this crime exercise, enthralls and deeply enjoyable. “Dial M for Murder” which is based on a play by Frederick Knott is a classic thriller with Hitchcock playing around with sequences and consequences. The setting up and revealing of the plot within the movie itself is comparable to the director’s act, while the latter triumphs.
