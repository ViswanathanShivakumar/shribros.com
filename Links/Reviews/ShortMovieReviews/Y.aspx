    <h2>Yennai Arindhal | 2015
    </h2>
    <p>
Gautam Vasudev Menon re-hashes what he did better with his previous cop films. Camera that moves with haste, a villain whose build is much better than the protagonist’s, a hero , who is hailed in this part of the world, and the music that’s inspired , from each of his previous films, Menon doesn’t leave a thing; Not to overlook his American dreams. However, there are a few jiffies that captures us with its charisma and that credit would partly go to the hero, himself. Otherwise, this is passable entertainment, that could've completed the cop trilogy in better style.    </p>
