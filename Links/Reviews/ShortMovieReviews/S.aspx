     <a name="Solaris"></a>
    <h2>Solaris | 2002
    </h2>
    <p>
Andrei Tarkovsky’s “Solaris” is a breath taking masterpiece, that was adapted from the book of the same name. Steven Soderbergh’s remake, with adorable cast including George Clooney as the main man, is far from being a masterwork. But, fairly, it also doesn’t try to be. It’s as thought-provoking , expressive and philosophical as the former, but doesn’t linger over us, as the former. Leaving aside the comparisons, this movie is well shot, directed and a glum piece of work, stained by its inconsistency; dull at times and poetic often, “Solaris” is fascinating enough.

    <h2>Shaun The Sheep | 2015
    </h2>
    <p>
Stop Motion animation is a tedious, yet gratifying procedure, particularly, when it comes to animation films that deals with nostalgic enchanters; and the Aardman studios are presently the best in doing it. Their latest “Shaup the Sheep” movie is a hysterically funny, silly, yet sweet experience. Meticulously animated, concisely written, delightfully detailed, this movie is cheery and completely slapstick. Although, might just not be up to the best of them, “Shaun the Sheep” is still one of their fabulous movies.

    <h2>Snowpiercer | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Bong Joon-Ho, the Korean master film maker, lands into English language movies, with an exceptionally well fashioned, philosophically enriched, dystopian atmospheric film. The whole of the film happens in a train that pierces the snow in a futuristic world, where no life, exists outside the train. “Snowpiercer” is violent, brilliant, smart, savvy and weird. Unlike Bong Joon-Ho’s other movies, that are character driven and minimalistic, Snowpiercer, ponders more on the subject that it proposes. “Snowpiercer” is a film that plays as an action entertainer, as much as a metaphor to the whole world itself.

     <a name="Spring Breakers"></a>
    <h2>Spring Breakers | 2012
    </h2>
    <p>
Harmony Korine’s “Spring Breakers” is ordained to be a cult movie; it’s made just for that, purposely.
Lit with neon, smeared with fresh skin, exploitatively pop art, “Spring Breakers” is about the thoughtlessness of the youth; the movie can be mistaken for its worship of the subject, which it essentially does, but subtly roots for the optimism beneath the superfluous wilderness, without which we are what we are, as civilized humans.  Wild, stylish and experimental, “Spring Breakers” is a piece of work that one might not be able to digest, but is incontestably, worthy to try it for at least to watch James Franco in his killer role.

    <a name="Stoker"></a>
    <h2>Stoker | 2012
    </h2>
    <p>
        As any of Chan Woon Park’s films, “Stoker” is visually sumptuous, valiantly chilling and meritoriously character driven. 
        Although, the subject itself might seem a little bit weary, Park’s precise direction and sharp tone, lets it in the right route. 
        Startling cinematography and a systematic performance from Matthew Goode make “Stoker”, a movie that doesn’t disappoint on many levels. 
        Even, when it doesn’t stand up to the heights of the brilliant earlier movies of Park or the deft Vengeance trilogy, “Stoker”, devoid of the cheap thrills, stands rock-solid on its own grounds.

    <a name="Shock Corridor"></a>
    <h2>Shock Corridor | 1963
    </h2>
    <p>
Samuel Fuller’s “Shock Corridor” is equally tragic, as it is violent and germane. Peter Breck as  Johnny Barrett leads the way in this psychodrama, that is effectually a communiqué of wickedness that exists in the social and political scenarios. Unexpectedly touching and excellently thrilling, “Shock Corridor” dutifully shocks with its craziness and of its characters. More of a nightmare, the movie captures, in essence, everything that can go wrong, in a prearranged execution of events.

    <a name="Stranger by the lake"></a>
    <h2>Stranger by the lake | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Alain Guiraudie’s French movie “Stranger By the Lake” is an atmospheric erotic drama. Vitally, protagonist’s dilemma in choosing love beyond rectitude is dealt with ease. 
        Partly thrilling, straight forward cinematography and thoroughly captivating, “Stranger by the lake” is an unusually engaging murder mystery drama of sorts. 
        While, could have been a little bit more intense, the movie with its eerie but beautiful backdrop is a rewarding watch.
    </p>

    <a name="Saving Mr.Banks"></a>
    <h2>Saving Mr.Banks | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        John Lee Hancock's “Saving Mr. Banks” is immediately admirable for a few things, astonishing performance by Emma Thompson, supported by the versatile, Tom Hanks, bright wits and the tragic history of P.L Travers. Sappy, but entertaining, “Saving Mr.Banks” is likeable, sugary and charming.  Whilst not magical as it might have been, Hancock manages to pull the best could.

    <a name="Shoot the Piano Player"></a>
    <h2>Shoot the Piano Player | 1960
    </h2>
    <p>
        Francois Truffaut’s improvisational “Shoot the Piano player” is a mixture of classy neo-realism and a little bit of dramatics. It is influential and a comprehensive fascinating study of human complex nature. While, one of the most sad movies of Truffaut, it is also one of his best. Charles Aznavour is fantastic as the shy piano player, who struggles to be all that he is. ”Shoot The Piano Player” is only Truffaut’s second feature, but is as bold as his “The 400 Blows”
    </p>
     <a name="Short Term 12"></a>
    <h2>Short Term 12 | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Destin Daniel Cretton’s short film to feature film adaptation “Short Term 12” is a compassionate drama, which has a clear heart and soul. It has a certain vision that is casually and inventively focused upon. The movie is very human and Brie Larson is fantastic in the lead role. Natural and superbly crafted, “Short Term 12” is a very good human drama that is compelling as it is realistic.

        <a name="Super Troopers"></a>
    <h2>Super Troopers | 2001
    </h2>
    <p>
Jay Chandrasekhar’s “Super Trooper” is a comedy, which wants us to laugh hard and fails even harder. It starts off with a promise and never quite delivers. There are a couple of hysterical scenes, especially on the highways, but weakened down by a preposterously nonexistent plot. Juvenile jokes juxtaposed with drug and sex jokes, does sporadically raise our lips a bit to smile, while that is quite not enough. Broken Lizards’ debut is a little funny, but entirely forgettable and it’s better to do so.

        <a name="Selma"></a>
    <h2>Selma | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        A compelling, and important piece of work from Ava DuVernay, “Selma” reminds us of things that we might have forgotten from history and shoots lesson for the days to come. David Oyelowo’s Martin Luther King Jr, is as charismatic as he could get. Well, placed as it is paced, “Selma” delivers well with an engaging and interesting biopic, as it is vital.
    </p>
       <a name="Sathuranga Vettai"></a>
    <h2>Sathuranga Vettai | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        With no technical prominence and not-so-attractive cast, somehow “Sathuranga Vettai” succeeds, if not entirely. What could have been a bad movie, is pulled off by the director , H. Vinoth to a decorously watchable, socio-alert, well-casted film. The protagonist, Gandhi babu, played by Natraj Subramanian ,is a conman, who fiddles money from the public with his con-mind-games. Frequently self-aware, the movie entertains, though falters with its got-to-say dialogues. Watchable and surprising, “Sathuranga Vettai”, sticks to what it intends.
