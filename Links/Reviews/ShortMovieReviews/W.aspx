    <a name="Winter Sleep"></a>
    <h2>Winter Sleep  | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
      Nuri Bilge Ceylan’s “Winter Sleep” , with Haluk Bilginer as a former actor, running a hotel on a scenic side in Anatolia, is epic in length and brilliant in composition. The struggle of characters in the movie are within themselves majorly, whilst failing to understand it. Very talkative,  captivating and demanding audience’s attention on every bit, “Winter Sleep” is a patient and faithful movie. Although, I found Ceylan’s previous work a masterpiece (Once Upon a Time in Anatolia), “Winter Sleep” is nothing short of a brilliant and masterful movie.

    <h2>Waking Life | 2001
    </h2>
    <p>
“Waking Life” is a masterpiece. It is a director’s dream; a dream with an ocean of dialogues that meander between thoughts, reality and dreams. Richard Linklater doesn’t trick us with the animated gimmickry rather takes us with a ride that is deep and zealous about the life it, disowns and owns in equal parts. It is inventive, meticulously constructed, and pompously art-house; Full of conversations, smudged with a surreal ambience, “Waking Life” takes a form that doesn’t just gleefully mess around your brain, but exceptionally and independently ponders your subconscious with existential facts; Hypnotic piece of work from Richard Linklater.

    <h2>Whiplash | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is the intensity, well-performed, visceral screenplay, that makes, “Whiplash” a success. J.K. Simmons antagonist as a teacher, who is infectiously perfect and tiresome, alongside noteworthy performance from Miles Teller, makes the movie, even more refreshing and thoroughly enjoyable. While completely unnerving, this is also predictable and unaccomplished. But dark and vividly entertaining, “Whiplash” is a success on Damien Chazelle.

    <h2>The Wolverine  | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       “I didn’t”, says Wolverine, in a scene, when his little friend asks him, “How did you know, there was a swimming pool?” It was a cool and witty discussion and probably one of the very few scenes, from the movie, which had the impact. “The Wolverine” features old Hugh Jackman, exhaustively out of his wits; and makes him travel to Japan. Not a bad episode and definitely not a bad one, in comparison with one of its spin off predecessor, “X Men Origins: Wolverine”, this movie plays plenty of action, with narrative that could’ve been better.

    <h2>Wadjda  | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Wadjda” is an audacious neo-realist-fashioned film, directed by Haifaa Al-Mansour; it is not courageous in way that it breaks rules of cinema or art, but for where it comes from, the corner of the earth, where cinema is perhaps the least wanted for. Albeit being predictable, the story of the little girl, Wadjda (Waad Mohammed ) is a critique on the society itself.  Spiritedly blended with resonance, it is filled with artistic sparkles. Familiar, but still affecting, “Wadjda” is a window to the country unseen in cinema.

     <a name="Watchmen"></a>
    <h2>Watchmen | 2009
    </h2>
    <p>
       “Watchmen” is Zack Synder’s most sensible movie yet. Riddled with disturbing sequences and packed a little less with action, “Watchmen” is more philosophical and multifaceted. Graphic, grisly and requires multiple viewings to understand the complex narrative structure. Jeffrey Dean as The Comedian and Jackie Earle Haley as Rorschach, particularly stand out , in this superhero film, that works on most of the parts.
