    <h2>A Girl Walks Home Alone At Night | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
“A Girl walks home alone at night” is shot in black and white and what happens in the movie, mostly happens at night and that justifies the title; Not only does that defend the title, but also is a blindingly imaginative piece of work, which crosses more than a few genres and offers a superlative pleasure, with its soulfulness. Ana Lily Amirpour’s movie is admirably deft and free flowing; bursting with punk style and gorgeous frames, this Iranian vampire western is downright original, electrifying, extravagant and combines romance, noir and horror with a jubilant mashup, which will loiter in our minds for a very long time. Sheila Vand does her part well, frequently with those fully lit expressive eyes and when she, as the protagonist, tells the young boy to grow up well and be a good man, we all get to know, what Ana Lily Amirpour’s intentions are.

    <h2>Gone Girl | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
We know David Fincher; that man who directs dark, gritty tales, in a way that only he could direct. “Gone Girl” lands from his pocket as another admirable illustration of his craft.  Based on Gillian Flynn’s book, this movie spins a wild tale that is riveting, electrifying, psychosexual and shockingly well made.
A manipulative attempt as it might seem on the outside, which certainly it is, the movie delves deep into human nature, to prove that wrong and succeeds mostly in building up that illusion; it leaves a scar on the audience, who are familiarized to the vivid portrayals of a minimal family in deep dysfunction. A triumph of sorts, for David Fincher; and Rosamund Pike, as well.

    <h2>Gattaca | 1997
    </h2>
    <p>
Andrew Niccol’s “Gattaca” is an excellent science fiction film (on genetic engineering), which is brainy and ambitious. It is about identities and the perils of technology misuse. Ethan Hawke and Jude Law play their parts with expressiveness. While the lab created babies is a likelihood in the future, this film looks at its loop holes, as does most of the sci-fi films, as a happy path never engrosses in films. “Gattaca”, notwithstanding its flaws and illogical situations, flourishes in ardently charming the audience and also is quite suspenseful in the right way.

    <h2>Goodbye to Language | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
I would like to know the purpose behind, Jean Luc Godard making movies, that are purposefully impermeable, having in hand, the characters and themes that are so unassuming and universal. Perhaps , I wouldn’t dare ask him, for the fear I have is not that he might reply back boldly, but that he would think about stop making such films; because, I love this post era Godard; perhaps just not as much as I did the young man. “Goodbye to Language” can be measured as, either a work of a genius or  the work of a man working on his philosophy of life, as the director did with his more recent films; either ways it is beautiful and involving in way that only Godard can pull it off.

    <h2>The Grand Budapest Hotel | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Wes Anderson is a talent, who you would not want to miss. “The Grand Budapest Hotel”, his latest venture, casts a great ensemble (all of them, you’d wish for), who perfect the movie, with their cartoonish characters. Wes Anderson takes the movie with this candy colored bookish frames and makes a great comedy, that can soulful drive you into his world; a world that you’d love to be into. Cakes, nostalgia, hill stations, perfumes etc, form this movie of character driven stylish and visually significant episodes. “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a delightful buffet with M. Gustave in an artificial world that is breathtaking and poignant. This is one of the best movies of the year.

    <h2>Godzilla | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        The central character of the movie appears very late in the movie and appears only for around eight minutes in the movie. Gareth Edwards, follows Steven Spielberg’s pattern of bringing the creature late in the movie, to give an impactful presence. And, yes, it works. But, this version of the monster is more about its character and intellect, near the end, which is the finest part. The movie is a profoundly special-effects laden spectacle, and worth-fully so.  With a thin storyline, this popcorn entertainment eclipses it, to become a strategized device to give a character to the monster, for the first time, perhaps.

    <h2>Guardians of the Galaxy | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy”, directed by James Gunn can be described as mad, funny Star Wars. It is full of CG sequences and the cast make the movie, ample fun. There are a few hysterical scenes and most of them can be safely credited to Rocket Raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper. While, sometime feels like too much frantic action, there is no denying that this movie is worth a watch.

    <a name="The Grandmaster"></a>
    <h2>Grandmaster, The | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Kar Wai Wong’s latest offers tons of gorgeous visuals, entertaining romance and poetic realm of details. “The Grandmaster” is an audacious effort as most of Kar Wai Wong’s movies, that leaps right from action to sadness and the depth of solitary sorrow.  Emotional, Stylish, Wong’s action scenes seem like a smooth and graceful, gorgeous ballet. Detailed consistently, expressionistic that thrives on character rather than action, “The Grandmaster” might not be the best of Wong’s movies, but is better than most of the year’s movies.

    <a name="The Great Beauty"></a>
    <h2>Great Beauty, The | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Paulo Sorrentino’s “The Great Beauty” is an ambitious, Fellini-esque, movie with colossal ambition and spellbinding performance by Toni Servillo as the celebrated writer/journalist, Jep Gambardella. The film itself is an exhaustive study of character , existentialism and a elusive satire on the high-class urban life. The poetic journey is sustained with some unique, fabulous music and is stupendously shot. The unforgettable film creeps into melancholy and the solitary beauty towards the finale, as Sorrentino confidently marches on with his masterstroke movie.
