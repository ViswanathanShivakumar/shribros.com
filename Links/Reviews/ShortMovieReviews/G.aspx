    <h2>The Grand Budapest Hotel | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Wes Anderson is a talent, who you would not want to miss. “The Grand Budapest Hotel”, his latest venture, casts a great ensemble (all of them, you’d wish for), who perfect the movie, with their cartoonish characters. Wes Anderson takes the movie with this candy colored bookish frames and makes a great comedy, that can soulful drive you into his world; a world that you’d love to be into. Cakes, nostalgia, hill stations, perfumes etc, form this movie of character driven stylish and visually significant episodes. “The Grand Budapest Hotel” is a delightful buffet with M. Gustave in an artificial world that is breathtaking and poignant. This is one of the best movies of the year.

    <h2>Godzilla | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        The central character of the movie appears very late in the movie and appears only for around eight minutes in the movie. Gareth Edwards, follows Steven Spielberg’s pattern of bringing the creature late in the movie, to give an impactful presence. And, yes, it works. But, this version of the monster is more about its character and intellect, near the end, which is the finest part. The movie is a profoundly special-effects laden spectacle, and worth-fully so.  With a thin storyline, this popcorn entertainment eclipses it, to become a strategized device to give a character to the monster, for the first time, perhaps.

    <h2>Guardians of the Galaxy | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy”, directed by James Gunn can be described as mad, funny Star Wars. It is full of CG sequences and the cast make the movie, ample fun. There are a few hysterical scenes and most of them can be safely credited to Rocket Raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper. While, sometime feels like too much frantic action, there is no denying that this movie is worth a watch.

    <h2>Grandmaster, The | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Kar Wai Wong’s latest offers tons of gorgeous visuals, entertaining romance and poetic realm of details. “The Grandmaster” is an audacious effort as most of Kar Wai Wong’s movies, that leaps right from action to sadness and the depth of solitary sorrow.  Emotional, Stylish, Wong’s action scenes seem like a smooth and graceful, gorgeous ballet. Detailed consistently, expressionistic that thrives on character rather than action, “The Grandmaster” might not be the best of Wong’s movies, but is better than most of the year’s movies.

    <h2>Great Beauty, The | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Paulo Sorrentino’s “The Great Beauty” is an ambitious, Fellini-esque, movie with colossal ambition and spellbinding performance by Toni Servillo as the celebrated writer/journalist, Jep Gambardella. The film itself is an exhaustive study of character , existentialism and a elusive satire on the high-class urban life. The poetic journey is sustained with some unique, fabulous music and is stupendously shot. The unforgettable film creeps into melancholy and the solitary beauty towards the finale, as Sorrentino confidently marches on with his masterstroke movie.
