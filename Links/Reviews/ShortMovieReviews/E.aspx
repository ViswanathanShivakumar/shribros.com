      <a name="Ex-Machina"></a>
    <h2>Ex-Machina | 2015
    </h2>
    <p>
It was surprising to see how minimal a very good, psychological science fiction can be; a movie like “
Ex-Machina” achieves what many blockbuster science fiction films, try hard to do. With Alicia Vikander’s flamboyant presence, Oscar Isaac’s wicked turn and Alex Garland’s deft, razor sharp direction, “Ex-Machina”, luminously tries to explore human nature, inside, what is not. A steady thriller that spews out fierce script every moment, and ends terrific.

    <h2>Edge of Tomorrow | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Edge of tomorrow” is a classy mix of “Groundhog day” and a number of war films. It is also an alien invasion movie.  It’s a video game and Tom Cruise trying to play it very hard to reach the final level. Tom Cruise and Emile Blunt form an exciting pair for this racy, clever, action entertainer, that is typically Hollywood and especially towards the end.

     <a name="Erin Brokovich"></a>
    <h2>Erin Brokovich | 2000
    </h2>
    <p>
Primarily, “Erin Brokovich” is a significantly savvy and smart; directed with a promise that Steven Soderberg seldom fails to keep up, right from his “Sex, Lies and Videotape”, “Erin Brokovich” combines the massive charm and talent of Julia Roberts, who plays the protagonist of the title character. Wholly and satisfactorily Hollywood, the movie also deploys Albert Finney and Aaron Eckhart in roles that we find tough to substitute. With flaws of plot and character, overshadowed consciously, “Erin Brokovich” is often exciting, if not completely real to life and entirely engaging.

    <a name="Epic"></a>
    <h2>Epic | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Blue Sky animation studio’s “Epic” is about looking into the diminutive life of the earth, that are observable to the naked eye, but our vision often fails to get their attention. Lushly colorful, clichéd, but essential character depth, “Epic” is a meek, but candid entry to the fairly run-of-the-mill year of animation movies. The foreseeable storyline advances, with enjoyable side-kick gags. The sugary little ride on the deer, the single quick moment when the birdy awaits the leaf-man who might have perished (although we know the obvious reason) make “Epic” a better preference of the lot.

     <a name="Elysium"></a>
    <h2>Elysium | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Neil Blomkamf’s follow up directorial venture to his brilliant “District 9”, falls a tad short due to its clichéd characters and narrative, while still managing to be visually authentic and dazzling. As the movie begins, it promises a unswerving storyline, which is carried away by the predictable Hollywood finale. Matt Damon and Sharlto Copley form a wonderful hero-villain duo, while Jodie Foster does what she is best at (as in Inside Man). “Elysium” stills remains a good summer science-fiction bereft of what made “District 9” brilliant, the novelty.

      <a name="Endrendrum Punnagai"></a>
     <h2>Endrendrum Punnagai | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
      “Endrendrum Punnagai” follows all that is needed to qualify to make a light hearted feel good movie, while displaying comic free spirited characters. Ahmed’s movie just moves on as it should, not without its faults, but not with and out its hilarious moments & sentiments too (well, can’t imagine a Tamil package without all that). The trio does very well, with Santhanam standing out. While, nothing notable, this movie can be considered worth a try or even a miss.

    <a name="Ernest & Celestine"></a>
     <h2>Ernest & Celestine | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
     “Ernest & Celestine” is the most beautifully animated (rather drawn) movie in years. With children’s book characters and finely etched characterization, Ernest & Celestine is funny, interesting, poetic and touching. Inspired by Belgium writer-illustrator Gabrielle Vincent's children’s books, is a nostalgic “Winnie the Pooh” for a matured audience, who still have the child in them.
