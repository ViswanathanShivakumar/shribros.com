       <a name="The Holy Mountain"></a>
    <h2>The Holy Mountain | 1973
    </h2>
    <p>
“The Holy Mountain” can be considered as the work of a prodigy; a prodigy, whose imagination, repeatedly shocks us with the disjointed, impetuous, grotesque and hallucinatory imagery, that’s more an exploitation than a film. It’s like Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel sat and imagined a movie, through their obnoxious moments. But with its dull, bizarre visual pervert poetry, Alejandro Jodorowsky, brings us a ride that might have just deciphered our shabby dreams, to a movie; The closing few scenes are amazing, as they are brilliant. Not for the faint heart, “The Holy Mountain” is worth the journey.

    <h2>How to Train your Dragon 2 | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
     Typically a 3D movie, “How to train your dragon 2” succeeds better than its predecessor.  It is completely engrossing and beautifully animated. It transcends to a thriller at a few instances, particularly, “Spirited Away” styled arrival of a major character. Dreamworks somehow, manage themselves to not come out of the circle they have around them and play it safe, everytime. “HTYD 2” is not an exception, nevertheless, this movie soars high with its visual element and a racy tale.

    <h2>Hunt, The | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        “The Hunt” directed by Thomas Vinterberg, is a devastating film. Mads Mikkelsen’s powerhouse performance, takes this gritty, riveting hard-to-watch piece of work to a disquieting and shocking thriller. 
        Grim, it might seem, but it is sharp and cuts through the society with an examination of the ill-fated subject, who becomes a victim of witch hunt.  
        Vinterberg’s fluid direction of the stirring subject and Mikkelsen’s knock-out performance, makes “The Hunt” , one of the best movies of the year.

    <a name="Her"></a>
    <h2>Her | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
                        Spike Jonze’s “Her” is brilliant and arguably his best work till date. “Her” follows the story of Theodore Twombly (the ever brilliant Joaquin Phoenix), who falls in love with an artificial intelligence -operating system. “Her” is soulful, original, interesting and sincerely sweet. Scarlett Johansson’s voice as the OS is as convincing as the human romantic pair for the protagonist. Cleverly written, deeply setup , genuinely shot, “Her” is one of the best romantic movies made.

    <h2>The Hobbit : Desolation of the Smaug | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        The “middle part” of The Hobbit series by Peter Jackson is an exciting film, which is thoroughly enjoyable as any of the Lord of the Rings movies or the first Hobbit. But what makes it differ from the LOTR films is the lack of emotional resonance and powerful dialogues. Nevertheless, it deserves to be seen for the thrilling, fun filled, action oriented film making. It’s beautiful and spectacular to watch.

     <a name="The Hobbit : Battle of the Five Armies"></a>
    <h2>The Hobbit : Battle of the Five Armies | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
The final episode of the Hobbit trilogy by Peter Jackson, “The Hobbit: Battle of the five armies”, is an indulging, thrilling adaptation of the final chapters of the book, only a little foreseeable. Though fitting enough, with visuals of epic proportions, that we assume is the characteristic of this series and of the director, there is also satisfactory characterization, which keeps the film impressive. There is always a need for more, to justify the flaws from the director, but the need for gratification could be derived from within the film’s payoff from its middle earth fantasy.
