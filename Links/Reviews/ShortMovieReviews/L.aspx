    <h2>THE LEGO MOVIE | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
         “The Lego Movie” is silly, hysterical, chaotic, wild, colorful and very engaging. Directed by Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, who pour nostalgia and spoofs alike to the characters, make “The Lego Movie”, funny and exciting. Not a landmark that it could’ve been, The Lego Movie does excite us with the Lego universe and the “special” hero on his way to cease the tyranny of the evil Lord. The live action towards the end is a surprise, and the whole of the movie is, in a way too.

    <h2>Lunchbox | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        This debut feature by Ritesh Batra is “The Shop Around the Corner” from India. While it never reaches the class of Ernest Lubitsch’s masterpiece, “Lunchbox”, with its stellar performances, flows like a fresh stream that pleases the crowd and charms them. Dealing with universal themes of love, loss, loneliness and friendship in a quietly predictable manner, “Lunchbox” succeeds, but only to an extent, where we wouldn’t question its ability of being a brilliant, innovative movie.
