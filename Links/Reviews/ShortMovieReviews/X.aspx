    <h2>X Men: Days of the Future Past | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       What started with The First class, continues with all the might in Days of the future past. It’s packed with action, conscious enough to make itself one of the finest episodes of the series. It’s full of fun, attractively well-crafted and an ensemble that would not let us take off out eyes from the screen. Bryan Singer comes back to what he started a decade ago and dutifully makes a fine film, that is not groundbreaking, but a big boost to the series.
