    <h2>Queen | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
“Queen” is a little charmer; feel-good film, well-acted by the lead, Kangana Ranaut, but nothing more than that. “Queen” wants to be big, in terms of its social observation, but then spoils its own purpose with too much of clichés. It is global, only with its location, but entirely a minor commercial feature in its heart, burdened with less-delicate ambition that is fresh, yet too obvious in its execution; that fails it, mostly.
