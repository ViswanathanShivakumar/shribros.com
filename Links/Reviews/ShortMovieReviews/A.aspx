    <h2>The Amazing Spider-Man 2 | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       This sequel to the reboot, has its moments. It is overstuffed with villains, but doesn’t falter like Raimi’s “Spiderman 3” and has an ending unlike most of the superhero movies. With its flaw of unbalanced narrative, balanced by sparking visual elements and wit, “The Amazing Spider-man 2” is just like Spidey’s character itself; confused, but heroic and successful.

    <h2>Ain’t Them Bodies Saints | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Debutant David Lowery’s “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints” is a poetic and the visually, the most satisfying film of the year. 
        Well-acted and tenderly scripted, “Ain’t them Bodies Saints” strength lies in the effective low-key artistry of the Western scenes. 
        Shot gorgeously, the dreamlike sequences gets the saga of love right. 
        “Ain’t The Bodies Saints” might not be impressive as an action-western set-piece, which it is not, but surely succeeds visually with its rustic and folksy tone.

    <h2>American Hustle | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        The charming and impeccable cast, alongside pacy, nifty direction from David O. Russell (who has been eyeing the academy awards every year) makes “American Hustle” a fun filled, 
        spirited exercise. As the characters play with each other, Russell plays us. Not to be missed, “American Hustle” relies heavily on its cast and Eric Singer’s high-octane script.
         While Christian Bale, Dominic Cooper and Jeremy Renner excel, the brilliant Jenifer Lawrence and Wonderful Amy Adams shine at the top.
         “American Hustle” is flabby sometimes, but the pop energy is rapturous and entirely amusing.

    <h2>All is Lost| 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        J.C. Chandor’s “All is Lost” is quintessentially Robert Redford’s show.
         While the plot is not very new, Chandor’s movie is minimalistic, modest, affecting, adventurous and thoughtfully intense. 
        The feat of the movie lies in how it places itself without a piece of land, human (other than Redford’s) or a piece of dialogue even (not considering the once-in-the-movie-one-worded monologue). 
        Redford encompasses fear, confidence, loneliness and claustrophobia with all that he has got and delivers. “All is Lost” is a survival drama that is thrilling and beautiful.

     <a name="Airplane!"></a>
    <h2>Airplane!| 1980
    </h2>
    <p>
       “Airplane” is not a spoof altogether. It is full of gags and ridiculous deadpan. Directed by David Zucker and Jerry Zucker, this comedy is often hilarious, as it is silly. Faintly dated, it is corny and with a good tempo. But, is also, very essential that placed a holder, for the movies, that were to come. Effective with the cultural references and performed with great wit, by Robert Hays, Lloyd Bridges and Leslie Nelson, “Airplane”, is very funny.
