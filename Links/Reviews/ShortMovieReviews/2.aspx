    <h2>3 Women | 1977
    </h2>
    <p>
Robert Altman’s “3 Women” is an artistic achievement that is defined by its capability to express characters in a way that only great films like, Ingmar Bergman’s “Persona” was able to achieve, while others failed.  It takes numerous viewings to grasp the fullness of this film. Intensely figurative, bizarrely lucid and accomplished with precision, “3 Women” is not complete without Shelly Duvall’s dazzling performance, as Millie. Supported with a skillful ensemble and cinematographed, remarkably arty, “3 Women” is an experience, that needs to be felt. The third act turns boldly brilliant and mysterious, only to finish the tale with panache and success.
