    <h4>Synopsis: “Endhiran” makes a good listen</h4>
    <p>
         There are directors who give controlled performances. There is one director who
            really hasn’t done that. It is Shankar. This applies to his movie’s music too. Typically
            the score of any of his movies depend only on his tang. But there is only an exception
            to this. This occurs when Rajnikanth is the central character of the movie. The
            vibration of the music sound different and this delicate experience are brought
            to us always by A R Rahman (except for “Anniyan”, of course). “Endhiran” forms the
            same team that brought to us “Shivaji” , which was again just a good listen to measure
            up to with the standards of the wizard boy. Now, switching over to each song in
            detail.

    "Pudhiya Manidha" -The song starts of with the techno sounds, not very startling
            for a song that describes a robot’s creation. Rahman starts the song with his soulful
            voice, although fairly de-effected by the mixing, followed by Khatija Rahman. But
            when S P Balasubramanian jumps in along with the rhythms, it sounds magnificent
            enough to tap our feet. Now, my disapproval is on the lyrics penned by Vairamuthu.
            “Hard Disk’il ninaivooti” ? C’mon, you must know nothing to write like that and
            you did. It could’ve been much better.
    </p>

        "Kadhal Anukkal" - Vijay Prakash starts off with a strange sounding humming
            and also more like Udit Narayan. The Guitar strums tell you that there is something
            in store with this song and it does. Shreya Goshal does a job, so perfect. It’s
            a number that might (you know what I mean by might?) grow on you, albeit the interludes
            fail stun you. But it’s a niece piece of work from Rahman. Again, the displeasure
            is majorly on the lyrics like “Neutron Electron” stuff. Are we still in the 1970’s
            or 80’s? What a bore, Vairamuthu you are these days.

       "Irumbile"- Now, this where our Rahman comes into picture both with his
            vocals and with the extra ordinary number for the album. This number is on lines
            with the “Fanaa” from “Yuva” or more of “Hello doctor” from “Kadhal Desam”. Ultimately,
            Rahman succeeds in bringing a disco – techno pop number , that stands out. Lyrics
            by Karki and Kash n Krissy are pretty cool. Electrifying and exhilarating number
            this.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Chitti Dance Showcase" - Well, here we are with the percussion mixed with
            nice arrangements and rapping jathis. Passable.
    </p>
  <p>
         "Arima Arima"  – the grandeur number that ripples across like the splendor
            of “Mudhalvane” from “Mudhalvan”. You know the king arrived. Sung resplendently
            by Hariharan and Sadhana Sargam, this is sure to be the runaway success. This is
            a song of the whole album, I liked the canto piece. With great interludes and nice
            chorus, “Arima Arima” is one damn good pick.
    </p>
      <p>
    "Kilimanjaro" - I’ll tell you the truth. I like Javed Ali quite a lot these
            days and he has sung this song. But, I’m not sure what would this song do to me
            in the future. Right Now, it sound like a 80’s number.Infact the chorale part is
            what makes the song sound that way. Even with the ethnic sounds, song can be more
            inventive. But yes, Chinmayi and Javed Ali pay the whole respect. I expect a bit
            more from our beloved Rahmanji.
    </p>
        <p>
       "Boom Boom Da" - A cool, haunting number ironically for a robot praise song.
            Yogi B , Kirthi, Swetha Mohan and Tanvi have rendered it full the fullest essence.
            It lingers.
    </p>
       <p>
        Yes. To conclude, it is not evergreen music, but an album that can make you sing
            along with it after a few listens for sure. But, the Rahman I know is much more
            pioneering and innovative than this.
