    <h4>Synopsis: Rahman beats the "BLUE"</h4>
    <p>
       Lately Rahman has been quite busy attending ceremonies and shows felicitating him
            for his oscars. And it has been quite a while since he released an album. The wait
            is over. "Blue" -scored by "Academy Award Winner" Rahman is out in the stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blue" starring Akshay Kumar, Lara Dutta and Sanjay Dutt , is a underwater thriller
            and Rahman says"It's important that you dont get typecast. It's also important to
            give the kind of music the film requires and have fun with it". Does it really feel
            good to hear "Blue"? Let us see.
    </p>
    <p>
       "Chiggy Wiggy" - The opening track proudly features Kylie Minogue. The composition
            opens up very well and features a very sweet voice and a mesmering tune,goes till
            the half way, only until Sonu Nigam jumps in. This is where the song takes a turn
            and goes the other way. But still highly enjoyable.
    </p>
    <p>
       "Aaj Dil Gustakh" - This is one superb piece of composition. Sukhwinder Singh
            and Shreya Ghosal's voice are absolutely absorbing. The chords and bass line proves
            the standards set by Rahman. An absolute must listen.
    </p>
    <p>
       "Fiqrana" - "Fiqrana" find audience immediately on the first hearing. It's
            part massy and part classy.Vijay Prakash sounds more like Rahman himself. Although
            the in between piece sounds a tad like one of Rahman's old compositions, this song
            is real creative work.
    </p>
  <p>
       "Bhoola Tujhe" - The only real melody in the album, rendered with authenticity
            by Rashid Ali, who keeps impressing. The song is a typical of Rahman's melody track's
            structure, but offers everything new on hearing.
    </p>
      <p>
    "Blue Theme" - Yes, it peppy. Has got all the sounds to make your heart pound
            and is just like Rahman's other Theme music, which tends to impress people, the
            moment they listen to it.
    </p>
        <p>
     "Rehnuma" - Sung by Shreya Goshal and Sonu Nigam, starts off giving great
            hopes of being a great song, but to me, it fails a bit, which doesn't mean it doesn't
            impress. The interludes are nice, vocals are good, but the song is a loud.
    </p>
       <p>
       "Yaar Mila tha" - The only conventional song of the album, but a good one.
            Udit's voice is a treat to hear and so is Madhusree's. "Yaar Mila tha" could impress
            people , who aren't impressed by the others congs of the album, coz' exactly the
            other way.
    </p>
        <p>
      "BLUE" doesn't cover all the varieties,but does give you a good time of enjoyment.
            If you don't like it on the first couple of listens, listen again. Thats how Rahman's
            works on your minds.
