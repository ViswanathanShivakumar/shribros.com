    <h4>Synopsis: “Raavan” – The best of Rahman in recent times and the reason – Mani Ratnam
                standing beside?</h4>
    <p>
       Well, it has been a couple of years since the greatest of the combos have come up
            together. In between there were Oscars and a lot more in a man’s life. And now this
            man who has been standing tall in full form, teams up with his original soul and
            lets us listen to his compositions in its pure form. Yes. Rahman and Maniratnam
            . I think that speaks more than what I did in the previous lines and along with
            Gulzar again.

      “Raavan”’s music is astounding, elegant, poignant. Rahman’s longing for the rustic
            chamber resonates through the album with seriously admirable musical stuff. Let’s
            go through it one by one.
    </p>
    <p>
         “Beera” starts off with a typical high note of Rahman, the husky male voice
            tearing the upper notes, but just gets down the rustic piece of tone along with
            folk twitches. It’s short and swift. And yes, it’s sweet even for a fast number.
            Sung by Vijay Prakash and with Rahmanisque pitches by Mustafa Kutoane.

       “Behene De” –commences with a strong influential music that could’ve very
            well been the back ground score of any of the films like ‘The Last Emperor” or “Kundun”.
            Karthik’s voice just slits the tempo controlled rhythms with the haunting artistry
            of Rahman’s very much capable tune of streaming into one’s heart. This floods across
            with various notes inclusive of the western interlude.
    </p>
    <p>
       "Thok De Killi" number maintains the running pace, rendered with precision
            by Sukhvinder singh and Am’nico. The highlight of the song is the rip roaring interlude
            with the pipe organ. Rahman does magic.
    </p>
  <p>
        "Ranjha Ranjha"  voiced with subtle erotic intensity by Rekha Bharatwaj
            and intensively accompanied with smooth over tone by Javed Ali, who proves to be
            one of Rahman’s brilliant new findings. This song is on the lines with “Rasiya”
            and creates an ambience with the string passing by every now and then. Utterly sexy.
    </p>
      <p>
   "Khilli Re"– “Yeh Rishta”’s Reena ‘s sweet rendition of the Rahman Lullaby
            is on lines with “Ghampoorani” of Bose and “Door kahi ek” from “Zubeidaa” and yes
            , you really get to feel the sweetness of the tune along with the versatile orchestration.
    </p>
        <p>
       "Kata Kata" sounds like a celebration song and when Ila Arun jumps she confirms
            it more than anyone else. Its just that spectacular interludes, small notes here
            and there along with the choral vibration standing on a scintillating tune makes
            the song a rocker.
    </p>
       <p>
       Now, I don’t think anyone who has read this should wait to listen it. Just go grab
            it. Listen and feel the music. It’s over and over the “Rahman” satisfaction. I’m
            greatly satisfied. If you don’t the first time, the fifth time you hear it, you’ll
            never let the player stop.
