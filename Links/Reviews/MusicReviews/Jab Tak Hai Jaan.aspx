    <h4>Synopsis: “Jab Tak Hai Jaan”'s music resonates well, as it reminds us of Rahman’s old.</h4>
    <p>
        Film music history often cites us an instance of the amount of impact that a music composer of the film might have from the genre of the director of the movie; for good or for bad. There can be many such citations made, but I’d like to confine it to one and that would be Yash Chopra’s “Jab Tak Hai Jaan” , Rahman being the composer.

               The album kicks off with “Challa”, a number, sung by Rabbi. With the guitars strumming at the launch, it’s a free flowing song, with a emblematic Bollywoodish flavour. Nothing much that Rahman experiments, but this sounded rather like a tune, that would outright come out of his mind, waken up in the middle of the night. The song progresses well and Rabbi’s inexorably soothing voice peps up the song. The interludes sway around normally, but then Rahman proves his spirit in the flavoured stanzas.

                “Saans” is an experimental melody with Rahman’s recent favourite, Mohit Chauhan and Shreya Goshal leading the vocals. The song starts with cellos , then the choirs and then the percussion jumps in. Instrumentally enriched, slightly muddled for a melody, “Saans”s flute interlude reminds us of “Warriors of Heaven and Earth” title number followed by Shreya’s mesmerising voice. The song works out for the most part. “Saans Reprise” that fits in towards the end of the album is a slower, yet soulful number, often better than the former.

             Raghav Mathur and Shilpa Rao sings “Ishq Shava” persuasively and assiduously. A pacy number, which will not fail to impress many listeners with the bits and bobs of an Arabic music delicacy as well as Rahman’s own earlier compositions.

                 “Heer” is a wonderful composition. As Harshdeep Kaur starts humming and the rustic rhythm starts, we know, Rahman has set off a beauty. Well, even when it reminds us of “Saawariya” from “Swades” or even shades of “Dheeme Dheeme” from “Zubeidaa”, it very well has its own stuff to delight us with a melodic treat.

               “Jiya Re” sung powerhouse by Neeti Mohan is a wild girlish song, which reverberates across and makes you hum it all the way, after a couple of listens. Contrastingly enough, after the guitar interlude and a little rap, the song changes itself to a more astutely slower tune and comes back to the older tune. Peppered with synthetic flute and superb guitar chords, the song is a special one from the album.

           The now versatile, Javed Ali makes “Jab Tak Hai Jaan” the title number, a fantastic one along with Sakthishree Gopalan. The song’s range of tang varies widely, and it entertains as it amuses. It starts with a vast violin orchestration alongside the song and then when the tabla jumps in, Ali takes full control; Razor sharp is his voice and it pierces, expressively the orchestration pleasurable enough.

             I usually do not write reviews for the theme musics that come along with the songs in an album, unless they are praiseworthy enough and “Ishq Dance” doesn’t have my attention after a few listens, for me to write a review of.

    </p>
       <p>
               “Jab Tak Hai Jaan” by Rahman is undoubtedly worth listening to and every one would have their own pick, but then it lacks the vintage A R R. If you are looking for a passionate, inventive, absolute Rahman,I’d rather recommend his new tamil album “Kadal”.
