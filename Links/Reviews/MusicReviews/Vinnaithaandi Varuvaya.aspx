    <h4>Synopsis: Rahman springs back in Tamil</h4>
    <p>
         “Vinnaithaandi Varuvaaya” – Gowtham Menon’s first venture with A R Rahman and Rahman’s
            first one in Tamil ,after his win at the Academy. Thamarai has penned all the songs
            but one which is done by Kaithapram (and of course in Malayalam).
    </p>
    <p>
          “Omana Penney” – Sung by Benny Dayal and Kalyani Menon , is a song that has
            all that you wish for. The comforting piece of music and the surprisingly attractive
            nathaswaram track along with the bassline. This nathaswaram brings in the classical
            twitch, further at the end, even when introduced at the launch of the vocals. Although
            the synthetic voice could’ve been more natural.
    </p>
    <p>
       “Anbil Avan” – by Devan and Chinmayi – on the first listen, sounds something
            like you’ve already heard before, but after a few more, no. This grows fine on you
            after the listens. Rahman could’ve perhaps avoided the Harrisique chorus, which
            most likely, he had incorporated on for Mr. Goutham. A fine song that also has a
            nice interlude.Devan and Chinmayi didn’t have to try hard. It’s their kind of song.
    </p>
    <p>
          "Vinnaithaandi Varuvaya"– Title track sung by Karthik is a typical lullaby-style
            melody. Commencing with the guitar strums and almost flat end vocals, the progression
            perfectly attracts you. With Rahman’s usual faultlessness of melody chord usage
            and pitch settings, graciously sung by Karthik, who even sound like Sreenivas even
            at the middle the song is a sure heart grabber.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Hosanna"– Frankly, when I heard the name of this song at first, guessed
            it would be a very perky number. On the contrary, the song is purely lyrical and
            peppy (but not to the extent I thought it would be) . There is also a Blaze hip
            hop in between although; it has a perfect nature of Indian music. Vijay Prakash’s
            soulful voice is a big value addition to the song.
    </p>
  <p>
           "Kannukul" – Sung by Naresh Iyer. This is one track that didn’t deeply astound
            me and might do on the future listens. With a straight forward rhythm and a synthetic
            sounding string, the song might not offer you anything perfectly new, but is certainly
            hummable.
           
    </p>
      <p>
  "Mannipaaya" – Rahman himself sings this duet with Shreya Goshal. Fantastic
            Melody. The melody that nurtures in an out of the soulful voice and the keyboard
            strings. Thamarai’s lyrics works out absolutely well within the blend. The violas
            (or rather the strings) are just Rahman’s class.
    </p>
        <p>
   "Aaromale"  – The song in Malayalam; sung by Alphonse; this is Rahman’s
            new area of attempt. The beginning sounding something like the western movie BGM
            and then the progression to the classical but choral tone is near perfect. Stylstically
            rendered by Alphonse, this number deserves attention. Excellent guitar pieces.
    </p>
       <p>
       “Vinnaithaandi varuvaaya” , as in most of the Rahman’s albums,might not help you
            in the first listen. But is sure to grow on you and it worth so many listens.
