        “Cross” for men has a very pleasant sweet aroma to start with. Entirely fruity at the beginning, “Cross” might not be for the one who demands complete masculinity in the top notes. Floral notes and fresh Citrus notes unfold later on and as the mildly woody fragrance forms the base note along with the subtle sweetness, “Cross” has reminiscence of the great “Boss Bottled” every now and then, but only to its fault. Reminds us of a lot of other colognes too. Lasts enough and has a good sillage.
