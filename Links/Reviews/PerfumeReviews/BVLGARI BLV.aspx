        Eau De Parfum - BLV is from the house of BVLGARI (Italian company and is pronounced “Bulgari”). The fragrance itself is pronounced “BLU”. Mostly a feminine perfume, BLV has the soothing warm and fresh spicy accords of Bergamot and Ginger. The Ginger is more prominent as the top note and provides a soothing effect. The middle notes are floral with the Indian linseed (commonly called flax) and Wisteria (notes that feel like a flowery clove). Sandalwood forms the floor of the perfume with a top notch woody base along with the mild tint of musk and the spicy yet comforting Vanilla (a touch hard to identify) as the sandalwood overshadows it. Slightly synthetic in smell yet soothing and luxurious “BLV” is a gentle fragrance with an effective sillage.
