      Armani Code was legend. One of its flankers – Armani Code Sport Athlete, is perhaps an unnecessary entry.  It smells completely, like lemonade. Lemonade. Unsophisticated, completely citrusy
and mildly fresh, Athlete was inspired by the summer Olympics held in London in 2012. But it doesn’t reflect the abundant energy as in Armani Code sport or the mystic wave that made Armani Code a great piece of work.

  While Lemon occupies the majority of the opening, ginger does slightly peep in, followed by mint and prominent Amber and Vetiver. While the projection is uncommonly disappointing, the longevity is also a major letdown. The bottle design is elegant, following the beautiful structure of Armani code and Sport.

  Citrus, Fresh Spicy and a little green, Armani Code Sport Athlete, is sporty and clean, but it just makes one feel like bathed in a lemonade and I guess that might well not be an achievement. It might help in summer, when you walk around the beaches, but no where else.
