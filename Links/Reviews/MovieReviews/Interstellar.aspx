    <h4>Synopsis: Nolan plays it very safe with “Interstellar”</h4>
    <p>
       There is an instant in Christopher Nolan’s latest science fiction film, “Interstellar” , where a viciously spinning space carrier, tries , with the protagonist’s cinematic endeavor to fix itself to a space station ;and on achieving the speed, gazes still at the moment, on the background of moving darkness, with distant stars. It’s an overwhelming experience and has all the wow factor that you would come to expect of a Nolan movie. But, to the dismay, the factor is very short lived.

        “Interstellar” pumps up all the enthusiasm that is essential, at the beginning when Cooper (played by the lover-by-turned-versatile-actor, Matthew McConaughey) along with a team of explorers, travels through a wormhole to find livable worlds hanging out in the wild vast darkness of space from the Dust Bowl disaster enthused futuristic world. The subsequent quests are charming and thrilling, but also uneven. While, his daughter, Murph (played by Jessica Chastain) awaits his impossible return, there are clear attempts by the director to make the audience comprehend physical science of the universe, customarily based on the theory of relativity.

       “Interstellar”, visually is a dazzling and well-crafted piece of work. The huge tidal waves, deserted icy planets, swirling event horizon are eye popping. But falters at a place more than just a few including its pseudo-science driven story line. Where its upside is its assured direction, its downside is its banal science fiction inspirations. With all the similitudes to Close Encounters of Third Kind, 2001: A space odyssey, Contact and many other science fictions, “Interstellar” has great appearance, style and substance, but lacks the balance between emotion and science, that its frequently compared Kurbickan classic companion, 2001: A space odyssey has.  All these space movies that stand against the tide of time have one great thing in common of not being able to answer the questions of the void and vastness of the universe. But, when the “Harry Potter” moment of it-was-me-who-did-it comes (talking about Prisoner of Azkhaban) jumped in near climax, the spine that was insignificantly fractured, was entirely wrecked.

       It is not even half as much as striving as “2001: A space odyssey”. The unrelenting problem of the movie’s story is pleasing, but not what it finally does. With a utterly pointless Miller’s planet sequence of events ,overwhelming sentimental jeopardy for a science fiction of deep space ambition, wastage of wonderful cast including Wes Bentley, Cassey Affleck and David Gyasi, jagged ingenuity including folks drinking beer where no wheat grows, “Interstellar” is not audacious as much as it could have been. The cosmic wonder is minimal and is wholly outshined by the lamenting characters of their nostalgia. It was a way-too-silly-moment for Nolan, when the father and daughter meet after all the wait, just to say “who cares” good bye.
    </p>
    <p>
   Nonetheless, “Interstellar” is a good, compelling, detailed and visually-enriched film. It tries not to reach the stars and be ambitious, rather plays safe, which is not what audience would come to expect of Nolan. Last year, there was another space movie that did not act intelligent or ambitious, but just did what it wanted, not even in the deep space, just near to earth. It won my heart, better.
