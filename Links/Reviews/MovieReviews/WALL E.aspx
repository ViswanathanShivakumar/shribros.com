    <h2>WALL-E | 2008

    <h4>Synopsis: WALL - E is Extraordinar - E</h4>
    <p>
          What you've heard is true : Yes ! This is a near animated masterpiece. Its groundbreaking
            by the fact that its the first Animated Art Film. "WALL E" is the Best Animated
            Feature for Oscars '08; 'WALL E' is what critics will love after a mediocre range
            of movies front running the year.

        Pixar does it again and as one of the reviewers said "It's getting monotonous" to
            review Pixar's, its almost always a masterpiece. WALL E is a whole new dimension
            to filmmaking and it is very similiar to Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton. "WALL
            E" tend to have the same kinda feeling that the climax of "City Lights" would give
            and to indian audience ,it would be something comparable to "Sadma" or "Moondram
            Pirai" with a happy ending.

      I will not /never let out the plot or the story in my reviews. May be thats the
            reason , this blog doesn't look like a review which is not important.
    <p>
          The first 40 minutes of this movie is for the film making students to learn how
            to visually narrate a story. Its not simple. This movie again is the most intelligent
            flick of all the pixar's.We need to understand ,conceive a lot of things. We can
            term it as a science fiction classic and it gives you a lot of dimension on how
            the future will be.

      "WALL E" is the Waste Allocation Load Lifter - Earth Class , a robot which falls
            in love with EVE - Extraterrestrial Vegetation Evaluator, another robot.Thats it.
            No more spoilers. "WALL E" is the darkest of Pixar's , and also the most innovative.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the most important point about this movie is that IT MAY NOT BE SUITABLE for
            non-critical viewers and children, who may very well appreciate the movie in parts.But
            for those who like "City Lights", "Modern Times", "E.T' or "Blade Runner", this
            is the movie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its visually breathtaking , hyper densely rendered (RenderMan rocks) , beautifully
            scored (music is the backbone) ,consistently thought provoking (you may need to
            watch this again to understand the details and intelligence) and faboulosly directed
            by Stanton,the director of "Finding Nemo". This movie might be the solution for
            the people who need a relief from the animation movies with the same way of animals
            talking , funny gestures, one liners. "WALL E" is different and its art.(Except
            for the portion of the movie in the AXIOM).
    </p>
      <p>
      I'm sure after a few years, this movie would be considered a classic or one of the
            greatest movies of all time, but will this be a world wide mainstream entertainer?
            I'm not very sure, because what hurts me is people getting up and going around in
            the theatre as "WALL E" was trying to express itself or outta- theatre people feeling
            it's not as good as Incredibles or Ratatouille. I pray that movies like this get
            accolades from mainstream audience.
    </p>
       <p>
     Note: "Presto" is the most hilarious short from the PIXAR and it is featured at
            the beginning of the film.It just rocks!
