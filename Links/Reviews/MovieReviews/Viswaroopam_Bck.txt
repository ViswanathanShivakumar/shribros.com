I say this is a perfect review!!! I felt the same pain going through the movie. Technically good, logically insane.

Disappointed with the review Sriram. This seems more a rant than an objective review. This would be more suited as a commentary on Vishwaroopam than a review of it. <br/><br/>I am not disagreeing with the overall suggestion that it is technically good but flawed in a lot of ways. I came back from the movie thinking the same that this could ve been a lot better movie by just changing a few scenes. Kamal seems to have wanted to make a taut, so-called international standard(hollywood seems to be his only inspiration here) action thriller but midway got cold-feet and decided to add a few safe-scenes for the Indian audience.. However I am going off-topic here about my criticism of the review.<br/><br/>There are a few grammatical errors, phrasing that can definitely be improved and a lack of any structure. I have come to expect a very high-quality of writing from the Shri-Bros and this falls way short of that, at least for me. That is what leads me to believe that this is a rant more than a review. For eg, How is "An agent trimming his hair in the midst of a bomb crisis to look better...taking his wife around when trying to diffuse a bomb...racing NYPD cars in the midst of Manhattan" crappy direction?? Crappy writing maybe if you feel that way but it can be crappy direction only if it wasn;t shot well. The car bursting out of the wall-apart:P I think the chase was decently shot. I actually loved the way the movie was directed. Kamal the director has been let-down by Kamal the writer and 'KAMAL-the big-egoed actor'.<br/><br/>Another simple example of inconsistency in the review -  " But one must admit that there only very few in Tamil Cinema who can even pull off this kind of a movie." which seems to imply this is definitely slightly(however infinitesimal) ahead of the curve for Tamil cinema. But the review states later - 'Writing and Directing a movie of Vishwaroopam cadre does not even take Tamil cinema anywhere close to international standards'. So, which is it?<br/><br/>You guys write brilliant reviews and I don't comment on them, please take my silence as satisfaction:P. But if I feel that anything is not up to mark, I want to make sure to let you guys know. It is up to you guys to take it or leave it. <br/><br/>Cheers

Can you guys organise this as per year of release or artist rather than alphabetically? Just a suggestion..
