    <h4>Synopsis: Darren Aronofsky's "Black Swan" is intense</h4>
    <p>
        Black Swan is one of those daring attempts seldom seen on screen. A physiological
            horror delivered by Aronofsky sure deserves the nomination in Academy. The movie
            revolves around a ballet dancer aiming at the pinnacle performance. The opening
            dance sequence itself will get you into the state of mind where Aronofsky will place
            you all through the movie. You will turn you face away or twist your fingers to
            manage through various scenes. You will want to watch them but may not be able to
            digest the intensity of what you see on the screen. This is exactly what the director
            has visualized and does not compromise a little. This is no place for the soft hearten.

        Natalie Portman as we know now, delivers the performance worth the Oscars. She almost
            carries away the movie with an extremely diversified performance that switches momentarily.
            There are multiple dark moments that accumulates all the pressure that is necessary
            to blow your mind in the final sequence. Incidents arranged randomly will push you
            into the puzzle which almost is impossible to judge. There are lots of intense shots
            both sexually and physiologically that may not be appropriate for all audiences
            but for the right ones, they cannot be better made anyway. The scene where Portman
            travels in a train at night and the visuals after getting drunk before the final
            rehearsal are just the sample.

        It's hard to believe at the end of the movie that a mythical tale performed in Ballet
            dance has driven us crazy and so the plot of the movie. There are lots of artistic
            and poetical essence throughout and the film maker does succeed in giving some edge
            of the seat moments. A particular mention goes to when Natalie Portman sits all
            alone in the practice room and the lights go down. Special care has been take care
            to deliver a feeling of watching the dance performance as good as live through camera
            angles. Slowly and deeply it pulls us into the performance. Half way through the
            movie we would not want Portman to open up a sharp object or dance on her toes just
            to relax a bit. Aronofsky is not letting you do that at anytime.

        The finale is a masterpiece. There is so much of creativity and originality involved
            in the way it is delivered especially with the shadow of swan reflecting Portman's
            actions. For a few minutes one may easily get engrossed and forget his atmosphere
            around. Vincent Cassel and Mila Kunis have done their part as it should have been.
            The stern faced dance tutor play a critical role in captivating the viewers. Characterization
            is the key here. Barbara Hershey as Portman's mother is another perfectly developed
            character. It could have been done less intense, but this is Aronofsky's movie and
            you get what you expect and not a penny less.
