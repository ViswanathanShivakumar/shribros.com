    <h4>Synopsis: "Slumdog Millionaire" is what Kinetic cinema is!</h4>
    <p>
            We've seen raving reviews for Danny Boyle's best yet - 'Slumdog Millionaire' - a
            British movie with Indian cast. I was the lone Indian in the whole crowd at Royal
            Oak - Landmark Art Theatre. Was it exciting ? Yes! I understood the meaning of kinetics!
    </p>
    <p>
          What "Slumdog Millionaire" offers is nothing new to Indian audience, but the form
            it takes is breathtaking. The form of movie making with all its provulsive mood
            destined to attain high quality direction effort and this is what the movie acheives.
    </p>
    <p>
     Danny Boyle acheives what Hollywood was not able to. Bringing the color, joy, essence
            and happy ending of Indian Cinema along with Dark, gritty, thrustful movie making
            of western films. This alone deserves a thousand credits.
    </p>
    <p>
         By now everybody reading this review would've known what the movie is about. Yes!
            It is about a boy from the slums of Mumbai on the hot seat for 'Who wants to be
            a Millionaire?" show. Dev Patel is Jamal, Friedo Pinto is Latika, Anil Kapoor ,
            the host of the show and Irfhan Khan the inspector. Nothing more about the story
            ,Go watch it!
    </p>
    <p>
            The style of cinematography is something comparable to the style of "City of God"
            and hence the camera in motion. Thats a perfect comparison infact. The movies mixes
            up past and present , but not as non-linear as Alejandro Innaritu's movies. This
            is where the buoyant editing comes into picture. Spectacular.The tale of riotious
            tough childhood and hoodlum of the brothers , the horror of pseudo orphanage people..well
            you know that's a tough life out there..how else can this be depicted? The kids
            were magficient cast.
    </p>
    <p>
    The film has dirt, joy, color, filth, beauty and everything you might expect from
            a movie.The only thing I felt as an Indian was the nativity which was missing. And
            for a western maker, I hope that doesn't matter. What matters is how it fits to
            the market it was made for , where the film scores a cent percent.
    </p>
    <p>
    There is a slight tone of philosophical twitch within the film and its for those
            who tend to see it that way or perhaps that was the filmmaker's intention. Dev patel
            , Anil Kapoor and Madhur Mittal (Salim) bring out their best, but who stands out
            in the first half were the kids and Irfan Khan. His eyes play his role.
    </p>
    <p>
      
            Then comes the pulsating soundtrack. I don't know what made Danny to bring in Rahman
            , but thats the movie's greatest positives. The movie starts going with 'O..Saya'
            till 'Jai Ho' and you'll never find it was almost 2 hours at the end. Rahman's score
            is one big reason. M.I.A's 'Paper Planes' was much better her in this movie and
            was as if it was made for the train scene. The Bollywoodish "Jai Ho" is not a perfect
            Bollywood number, but thats how westerners perceive Bollywood musical and its not
            too far away frm being perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
    With a very happy ending , it was hard for me to think of this movie fetching this
            year's oscar along with "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button","Milk""Revolutionary
            Road", but sure is a place for it in the nomination's list for Best picture,director,editing,screenplay,cinematography
            and Rahman's music. IT IS WRITTEN.
