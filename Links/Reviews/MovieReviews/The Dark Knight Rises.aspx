    <h4>Synopsis: A terrific movie and conclusion to one of the brilliant trilogies ever.</h4>
    <p>
        The finale of the masterful Superhero trilogy by Christopher Nolan, “The Dark Knight Rises” 
        is very fitting and one of terrific movie going experiences that anybody can have. Nolan, 
        one of the visionary masters of cinema has flair of mixing art and action, even though prefers 
        to end this particular trilogy in the latter fashion. If “Batman begins” was a superior way of 
        rebooting a deceased series and “The Dark Knight” was re-invention of the superhero genre,
         “The Dark Knight Rises” is the closest it can get to stylistic, artful, superhero cinema.

           Speaking about the story and plot of the movie becomes immaterial,
            as I write this review a couple of weeks later I’ve watched it and the movie is out in the halls.
             The villain Bane from the comic, played viciously and impeccably by Tom Hardy, Cat Woman, played 
             with sleekness by Anne Hathaway are the beautiful and typical moves by Nolan. Micheal Caine , 
             Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman dutifully play their roles with perfection. The surprising element 
             is Joseph Gordon Levitt as John Blake. Even when Marian Cortillard has a role with minor screen presence,
              she has got a vital one. Bane groans, growls and with his power packed muscles and rancorous eyes,  
              he plunges Gotham to darkness and with Batman out of sight for quite a while, the movie delves deep 
              into the modern day crime
            scenario with even more darker and realistic tones.

             Be it the mind boggling overture of Bane with the skyjacking,
              or the one-of-the-best-ever-intro for Batman, or the riveting 
              underground explosions or the eventful climax, Nolan chooses 
              himself with a way to do it. He succeeds. Although the movie 
              doesn’t dare into the territory that “The Dark Knight” audaciously did, 
              it still makes it high enough to be a clever one. Hans Zimmer remains
               the backbone of the movie; the music threatens, echoes, the chants resound; it makes us succumb to the fear, 
             chaos and pain, which the film manages to sink into.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
       Wait a minute; I forgot someone here. Oops! Christian Bale? 
       Well, this time around, with much more prospect to show himself,
        than being shadowed by an eccentric villain, he does what he is good at; 
        He lives as Bruce Wayne and his alter ego. The movie is meticulously crafted and is evident in every shot. 
        There is never a dull moment, which I can think of. Well, then the movie is not without its flaws
         but then when you sit, watch a superhero movie and come out as gladly as you can, it hardly matters. 
         Although worshipped, it makes no sense to make the director,
        a film God yet in the world of cine polytheism.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The Dark Knight Rises” is one of those rare breed of movies, 
      which has smart insight, tactical philosophy, awe-inspiring action, 
      black wits and the all the more, highly rewarding fun. Christopher Nolan
       makes his moves, way too carefully for him to make a mistake especially 
       when it comes to the “Dark Knight Trilogy” and we all 
      (well, most of us) hope he gets the reward this time around.
