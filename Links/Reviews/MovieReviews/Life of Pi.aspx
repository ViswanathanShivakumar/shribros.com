    <h4>Synopsis: “Life is Pi” is breathtaking and a highly spiritual meditation of life.</h4>
    <p>
         As far as I can remember, Ang Lee’s “Life of Pi” would be my choice of the second best spiritual film, after Kim Ki Duk’s  “Spring, summer, fall, winter and Spring”. It is just as gorgeous, and  also ,more of a technical marvel. The film is based on the French-Canadian writer, Yann Martel’s book of the same name. The story follows the spiritual voyage of Pi Patel (Suraj Sharma/Irfan Khan), who loses his family and gets caught up in a place where he shares the same space of survival with a Bengal tiger.

          The story might seem like an adventure, but then Ang Lee’s movie digs deep in to aspects of life and faith. The film’s opening is one of the most delightfully shot, lyrical and an art book’s front cover alike sequences, with a cheerful Tamil song composition by Mychael Danna. As the movie progresses, there are thorough vindications of growth of Pi’s faith over God. As the movie launches to the journey to Canada from Pondicherry, Ang Lee takes total control of the adaptation.

       While, the scenes in the sea are astonishingly beautiful and compelling, it’s towards the finale, the tone of the movie becomes even more interesting with its philosophical flavour. It jumps into more hope, faith and fantasy. Commencing with Pi’s mother, played by Tabu’s faith in religion and God, the movie ends in Pi, with his ‘swollen with pride’ command saying “And so, it goes with God”. The major intrigue of the movie, although lies at the end, where in the Japanese ship insurance investigators, ask for the truth from Pi. After hearing the story of Pi, they demand the truth and Pi offers them another “story”, which is even more awful and ghastly, than the out of the world former one. That pulls up the trigger for viewers’ reaction to the ambiguity of the story. Both completely relevant and skilfully built, but then, faith and believability stand between them. Ang Lee watches us with a grin.

       “Life of Pi” stands tall as a staggering technical achievement, with each pivotal moment of the movie, placed eventually all along. It is magnificently shot, luminously and heart-warmingly. Danna’s score is intoxicating and has always been. Ang Lee uses 3D and CGI (Rhythms and Hues) accurately and utterly inevitably, with the CGI creatures (the astounding tiger), and the awe-inspiring atmosphere.

         Being closest to the Indian nativity, than most of the Hollywood films (though not evidently near perfection), “Life of Pi”, offers us with a startling visual spectacle, along with overwhelming spiritual tone. Quite clearly one of the best films of the year.
