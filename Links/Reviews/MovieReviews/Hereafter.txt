Hey Srivathsa,
<br/>
<br/>I agree when you say that this isn't Clint's best effort and surely it ranks no where closer. Also the ending leaves you some what dissatisfied. But the honesty with which the characters are portrayed lift the movie up from the mundane and offcourse Clint's eye to the detail is evident everywhere. Though I would want to say I did like the part where Matt Damon's character makes a bitter disclosure to Melanie. That was my favourite scene of the movie along with the Tsunami scene offcourse. :)
