Good One ! both the movie and review. :) Guess this is your come back after a long time writing reviews. Great movie at times good to watch when you feel down and this movie inspires you to do what you wish to do. I liked the final punch the princess says " We are not aware of where our destiny is , but we should be BRAVE to accept whatever life gives us"<br/>
