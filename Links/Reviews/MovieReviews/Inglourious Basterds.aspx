    <h4>Synopsis: These bastards are not going to be inglorious; they will live gloriously in the history of cinema as the dogs of Quentin did.</h4>
    <p>
        This is one of the movies that people in India have waited long since their friends
            in America have given great reviews. This time it’s different for me, I kept my
            finger crossed about the movie being released in Chennai since Bangalore theaters
            screened it weeks back. It’ been long since Quentin had his hand on a movie as a
            whole and now he delivers another masterpiece which is daring enough to rewrite
            history. Did I hear anyone say this is an English movie? I remember listening more
            of German than English. Get ready to read lot of subtitles.

         Tarantino’s detest for Nazi’s is clearly seen through the eyes of the bastards he
            has created. The story is narrated in a typical Tarantino style with chapters and
            cross scenes glued with names. He retains the style that we have seen all his character
            to posses in reservoir dogs, pulp fiction and kill bill. There is lot of scenes
            that provides pure Quentin essence. The titling, introduction of the so called ‘the
            bear jew’, Climatic sequence, the first chapter conversation.

          This is not a war movie as many of us have perceived it to be. The base plot is
            very simple, a team of people called Bastards set to kill as many Nazi’s as possible
            whose intentions combine with that of a Jewish girl. Her family was brought down
            by Nazi’s and she sets to have her revenge. Sure a special mention is necessary
            about the cinematography. Brilliant work! I particular enjoyed the way Brad Pitt
            carves the sign on Nazis that remains on them all their life. The movie is slow
            paced with very less action and lot of conversations. Tarantino has spent a huge
            effort in drafting these dialogues. May be watching the movie over and over will
            leave better impressions in people mind.

        The opening chapter is sheer class. Colonel providing a comparison on rat and squirrel
            is what anyone would expect from Quentin’s movie. The wood on floor chop into the
            camera as bullets pierce them, this is where the action begins. Most of movies scenes
            are developed to bring the impact in final sequence. Quentin takes his own time
            and provides clear details. Speaking about the detailing, there are lots of minute
            specifications that many may miss to notice. The feel of adding cream to what you
            eat is also portrayed profoundly.<br />

        The scene in bar, Nazi’s playing games and bastards there to discuss on Operation
            KINO is typical Tarantino’s fashion. Guns on each other’s balls and they have a
            conversation. Everyone keep waiting to know who’s gonna blow whose? Finally you
            don’t find anyone alive.

          Before the climatic sequence, the hall for the grand premier of a movie which the
            fuhrer himself will watch is visualized with lot of fine points. You see things
            happening around and camera follows people moving giving the idea of the hall structure,
            where people are seated and how the plot works. Quentin gets you ready for the grand
            premier he has planned for. Gives you the time but does not wait and blasts everyone’s
            mind off the skull. A must watch not just for Quentin fans but for any movie lover.</p>
