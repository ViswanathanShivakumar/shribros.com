    <h4>Synopsis: A gritty portrayal of labor with new age Tamil Cinema.</h4>
    <p>
        I would say it was “Kadhal” that made an impact on the viewers, necessitating and
            propelling Tamil cinema to a fresh and diverse frontier; of course accompanied by
            the rural camaraderie of films like “Paruthiveeran” and “Subramaniyapuram”. It means
            to be realistic, gritty, not wholly breaking the shackles of Tamil filmdom, but
            making a way for films in the future to follow the healthy trajectory. “Angadi Theru”
            is one such movie that sticks to the urban portrayal of realistic truth and modern
            slavery and does it cleverly.

    <p>
        Starring newbies, Magesh and Anjali ,who give a scintillating natural performance,
            the movie is all about the romance that is entwined within the cruel hands of merciless
            labor and slavery in modern day Indian metros, in this case, Chennai. This is something
            on par with concentration camps for the salesperson, who struggle to withstand from
            their cruel life drenched in poverty.

        The film is full of poignant humanity, a tad too much at times too. Even when it
            tends to be a tear jerker, it never over does it. The commercial portion of it takes
            its head up, briefly, which is perfectly acceptable, for how long can audience see
            the reality and grittiness of the movie?
    </p>

        Cinematography is absorbingly outstanding, although a few shots tend seemingly similar.
            G V Prakash’s music is ordinary and the synthetic usage of instruments is jarring.
            Also, interesting inspired by the Brazilian gritty music style. The performances
            are devastatingly real, credits to them and the dialogues form the backbone and
            the most integral part of “Angadi Theru”.
    </p>
    <p>
        Vasantha Balan joins the elite list of directors, with his second venture, after
            the rural solitary brother story “Veyil”. We can keep an eye on him; for he has
            got a very good eye.
