    <h4>Synopsis: Eastwood's lesser movie, but worth a watch.</h4>
    <p>
        "Hereafter" is perhaps, the veteran Clint Eastwood's only film that deals with the
            paranormal. However the solitary way it is supernatural is that, the protagonist
            communicates with dead people. If not, it's entirely an emotional drama on individuals,
            who have witnessed death, one way or another. Eastwood is known for his organized
            and pertinent direction and his "Hereafter", even though; nowhere near his best,
            it is an enduring and watchable drama.

        "Hereafter" kicks off with a stunning, baffling and heart aching tsunami recreation.
            Following the mode of Alejandro Inarritu, the movie revolves around three stories.
            The opening scene sees a French journalist, Cécile De France (played extraordinarily
            by Marie Lelay), making it to death (well, almost) and coming back to life again.
            Somewhere in London, twin brothers, Markus and Jason (played by the McLaren brothers)
            are trying to cover up for their mom's drug/alcohol addiction, but get separated
            by death, when one of them, meets with a mishap. In America, a blue –collared man,
            George Lonegan (played by Matt Damon), has a connection to the after life. "Hereafter"
            is all about how all these three characters intervene.

        First of all, Kudos to the visual effects team for the mind-boggling tsunami sequence
            at the beginning. As in any Eastwood's picture, the movie is lucidly dark and well
            cinematographed. The old timer surprises us with his ever shining direction. There
            is no particular moment, where the film falters, but, when the credits roll, there
            is a sense of hushed dissatisfaction, bizarre for a Clint Eastwood movie. That's
            most likely because, with the deftly built characters on one hand, there are shaky
            characters, aberrantly fashioned like Melanie (Bryce Dallas Howard). Even then,
            "Hereafter" scores in nearly, all the other parts.

        "Hereafter" is pretty capricious and a story about the dead people, that doesn't
            exactly deal with scares (like the visually stunning Gasper Noe's "Enter the void").
            It is about compassion, people and their love for each other. The film poignancy,
            dealt with straightforward recitation.

    <p>
        "Hereafter" deserves respect for Eastwood's deft direction and also a slender bitter
            nod for its patchy composure..
