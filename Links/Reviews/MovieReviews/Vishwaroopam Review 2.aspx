    <h4>Synopsis: “Vishwaroopam” is uninvolving and self depreciating.</h4>
    <p>
        When I start writing a review on a movie, I attempt to be as impartial as possible 
            and I always do justice to my cinematic perception. Just before I commence the
             review of Kamal Haasan’s latest directorial venture, the mega budget “Vishwaroopam”, 
             I  wish to give a preamble on the mindset of the Indian audience on Hollywood standard 
             of film making and for a good reason. While we could deal with the reason the later part of this article,
              I’ve heard a lot of my friends and pals comparing many of the mainstream Indian movies with Hollywood.
               Well, there is nothing immoral doing so, since Hollywood has set a baseline for a superlative standard, 
               which can even be debated when it comes to artistic sense.
                But the major aspect that the audience take into consideration is the budget that is being involved, 
                the action sequences, and scenes that make their jaws drop. Whilst, this seems to be only a very small part
    </p>
    <p>
        Kamal Haasan’s “Vishwaroopam” is an interesting enterprise because 
            it made me think on a man, who was once the ray of hope for Tamil cinema
             and was considered as a man who could make films, with even low budget 
             (examples like “Mahanadi” is worth mentioning) to international standards.
              Now, this evolution of the man I’m speaking about, Kamal, to a more non-contemplative 
              and middle-of-the-road crisis driven human being, is all the more sub-standard.
               He has directed a couple of fantastic movies that are “really” international 
               (talking about “Hey Ram” and “Virumaandi”), although with trivial flaws. I wish Kamal,
                was trying to set right his flaws of his earlier attempts rather than moving on to make more
                 superficial, shallow, and self heroic action entertainers. Now, that he has preferred the focus
                  of an action entertainer, I expected him to stick to the sensibilities connected with it. 
                  There are good mainstream entertainers and no brainers that give us guilty pleasure
                   of watching them and deeply succeed in doing so. But, a pseudo intelligent shot at 
                   juxtaposing, the entertainment with a purportedly message-driven value of a film is not
                    for a man of this calibre. “Vishwaroopam” failed, even as a guilty pleasure 
                    movie to me because of the above mentioned dim-witted and pseudo-shrewd idea.

        Kamal Haasan as an actor is just great and no one would doubt it.
            He lights up the movie, on all right notes principally with his entry as the dancer.
             The first few minutes, the best part of the movie (movie alone), kicks off well and adequately plotted.
              But all good ends right after the QT-Rodriguez-Guy Ritchie, styled stunt scene,
               which was well choreographed. Right after that, be it in Afghanistan or New York, it is a downhill trip. 
               Unremittingly uninvolving screenplay, messy characterization of the protagonist himself, 
               follows throughout. There were a few fortunately nicely directed moments 
               (including the execution of the alleged traitor), that again were eclipsed by
                more than enough preposterous scenes and irrelevant interventions including the
                 talks on Kamal's usual theory of God and existentialism. I would like to brief more on that 
                 “messy characterization” part. A movie’s character should be a character which fits to the movie alone.
                  Satire can be a part of a single movie, which theme can fit in to the character 
                  and theme of the movie. As a basic character build, a protagonist who gives works in espionage
                   environment, cannot reveal his emotions in front of the group he tries to fit in.
                    Involving in actions that directly notifies the enemy that the character does not belong 
                    to the group is rationally being dumb. While, I understand the hero is good hearted he is 
                    allowed to do so, personally and not in public. It is sheer common sense, even for a commercial
                     mainstream mass entertainer. That was just an instance and Kamal disheartens us in many such moments.

        The BGM helps the movie and Shankar Ehsaan Loy didn’t disappoint. The cast is surely talented, 
            but mostly wasted, including the ever incredible Nasser and Shekar Kapoor. Rahul Bose is a great actor,
             but despondently fails as Omar and for the first time, a director has underused him trying to 
             underplay too much, for his talent. Technically, it’s not an achievement, but pleasing enough, 
             though the freeze frames were quite an unnecessary gimmick work. The car chases were way too chaotic.
              The new comer Pooja does it well, and Andrea does her part well too. As in any other Indian movie,
               weak Hollywood actors do their minor parts, inadequately, except the one who plays the commanding FBI agent. 
               It is pointless to search for answers to questions on logic, since it is unimportant anyways. 
               Too much hard work has surely gone into this. Many scenes had intricate details, but one might wonder 
               what is the point in having too many details for a scene that is too absurd.
    </p>

        And not to forget the final moment, where all the four major characters walk in parallel, 
           as Kamal gives straight forward note on the sequel as an answer to the absurdly pointless statement from Pooja.
            I did note that Shekar Kapur at the right corner of the screen, grinning ashamedly to that petty talk. 
            So, did I, because, I exactly knew the reason.

        The good thing about “Viswaroopam” is that I liked it better than Ravikumar directed “Dasavatharam”. 
               “Vishwaroopam” might have been intended to the mass deprived of authentic good quality movies for a while. 
               Well, luckily I’m not into that scarcity, yet.
