Half of your review is absolutely non-sense ..unnecessarily talks about budget, why people comparing this film to hollywood movies.  And finally you say -The folks who might love “Vishwaroopam” are the people deprived of authentic good quality movies for a while<br/><br/>Your main concern seems to be about people who like the movie and not the movie itself. <br/><br/>I could not help laugh reading - Well, luckily I’m not into that scarcity, yet .. ha ha <br/><br/>So I feel your review is substandard than the movie itself . lol

@ reviewerofreviews ; Thanks for taking time to comment on the above article.<br/><br/>Your comments, somehow vent out only your anger and I totally agree to the fact that not everybody has the same opinion on a particular thing. What might seem non-sense to you might not be the case for everyone else and slightly more in-depth look into understanding the review might explain you the fact that it is more sensible that you might think or assume it is. But, surely before someone comment could on a review, they should probably dig deep into it to understand what the writer says and be more appreciative than just venting out a partial statement just out of anger.<br/><br/>Thanks Again!<br/>

Ok..you handled the criticism pretty well. that is the most important quality of a blogger .. cheers!<br/><br/>I have 2 suggestions ..you can take them if you like it <br/><br/>1) Do not bother about mass opinion and try to compare it in your own review<br/>2) Do not talk about the others opinion.. rather just focus on the movie .The statement you made in the end will hurt many though you had a disclaimer.. "No offense and no blame meant"<br/><br/>Thanks !

@ reviewerofreviews: Thanks again for checking back and the suggestions.<br/><br/>For any suggestions on writing and the website, please do use the feedback in the home page, which is more suitable and for anything that we might wanna discuss on the movie alone , could be done here, which i think makes more sense, which otherwise could lead the topic drifting away to a different discussion than the movie itself.<br/><br/>Thanks Again!
