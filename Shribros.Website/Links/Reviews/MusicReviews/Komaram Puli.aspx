    <h4>Synopsis: Komaram Puli hits many notes and rightly so</h4>
    <p>
        I have to admit this. I wasn’t impressed on the album the first instance I listened
            to it. First thing, I did not understand the language and hence the power of lyrics
            was incomprehensible. But, I’ve always known, the initial listen doesn’t always
            pay respect to Rahman’s work of art and his music has the inclination to nurture
            radiantly into you. This is has been factual on almost all occasions and even this
            time, with his most recent Telugu album – “Komaram Puli” directed by S.J. Surya.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Power Star" -– Rendered by Vijay Prakash and Tanvi Shah is characteristically
            made as a chartbuster number. It injects you with a percussive delight and peppy
            tone, halted then and there by a “Power Star” chore. The interlude doesn’t check
            out new outings, but sticks to the old template.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Amma Thale" - The second number is perhaps a surprising number, performed
            on a Uditisque tone by Naresh Iyer and Sujatha’s daughter , Swetha Mohan. The number
            mixes consciously a haunting melody with a pace that slightly reminds you of Rahman’s
            dazzling “Theekuruvi” composition in his Tamil album “Kandgalal Kaidu sei”.
    </p>
    <p>
         "Maaralante"  – Rahman himself pitches in, for this upper notes number.
            This piece of music is Rahman’s own favorite in the movie and the song proves to
            be one good number. It’s almost a clinical effort by Rahman to make this over tonal
            song, effective and engaging, with those heartwarming choirs surrounding the primal
            essence.
    </p>
    <p>
  "Maham Maye" - Right now, this is my beloved of the album. The razor sharp,
            but the soulful voice of Javed Ali makes the song astounding. Along with Suchitra’s
            spiky voice, the song resonates with greater ambience. Rightly did Rahman choose
            Javed Ali for this number that makes you freak out.
    </p>
  <p>
         "Dochey" - I’m positive that no one would deny me telling that, this number’s
            rhythm transparently resembles with “Gangsta Blues” of “Slumdog Millionaire”, but
            then the song itself doesn’t. Vocals by Shreya Goshal and Lady Kash n’ Kissy. This
            is a party number that didn’t greatly amaze me.
    </p>
      <p>
    "Namakame"- This is on lines with “O Palanhare” from “Lagaan” or “Manmohana”
            from “Jodha Akbhar”. Sung by the versatile trio Chitra, Madhusree and Harini, this
            number is the sweetest of the album and grows proportionally on the count of the
            listens.
    </p>
        <p>
       “Komaram Puli” is just more than an ordinary Rahman album that grows on you. It’s
            not spectacular, which is what we would always expect from the Oscar winner. It’s
            not fair, is it? Sachin cannot hit a century in every inning. We should be okay
            with the half centuries too.
