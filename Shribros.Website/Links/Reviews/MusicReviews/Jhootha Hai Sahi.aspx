    <h4>Synopsis: I call it “Stand and Deliver”</h4>
    <p>
        "Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na” by Abbas Tyrewala and its music was a runaway hit a couple
            of years ago and here this combo of Abbas and Rahman is back with “Jhootha Hai Sahi”.
            The audio features a lot of the singers who lent their vocals for the songs of “Jaane
            Tu..”. Below are the tracks. Reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Cry Cry"– Rashid Ali’s soulful voice and the bongo rhythms by the side
            of the bass line, delightfully and vividly places the song as one of the best of
            the album. The saxophone interlude that melts into the flute is nearly an emblematic
            of Rahman. Also the lyrics did hark back me of Abbas tryewala’s maiden “Jaane to
            ya Jaane Na” track “Kabhi Kabhi”.
    </p>

         "Mayya Yashoda"-Starts off with a rustic flute bit, remarkable enough to
            color the scene with festive mood. The song didn’t have me on the roar the first
            time of my listen, but then it leisurely did. Sung by Javed Ali and Chinmayi, this
            song makes you bustle. The flute interludes are stupendous. The second interlude
            did make me sense that, I’m listening to something that I’ve already heard earlier
            from Rahman.

        "Hello Hello"  – Whoa! This number unswervingly reaches the top spot of
            the album. Rendered, so fervently by Karthik, the number’s interludes and the guitar
            strums in the backdrop are just incredible. The violin fillers are awe inspiring.
            The best of the album. The bad news is its only 3 minutes and 32 seconds.
    </p>

          "Do Nishaniyan” & “Do Nishaniyan 2" - The Sonu Nigam vehicle. The opening
            opulence is entirely and perfectly managed into a versatile melody. Very soothing.
            The flute bit that traverses along as the interlude is in all probability, what
            makes Rahman still the best.
    </p>
  <p>
        "Pam Para" – A song, which is certainly not one of its kind and with an
            unlikely peppiness. The Rhythm is neither innovative, nor is the saxophone fillers
            at the end of the lines. But the song certainly makes you shake; at least will make
            you do that for a while.
    </p>
      <p>
   "I’ll be waiting" - Another piece of immense melody that starts as a waltz
            classical piece and then turns to a rustic folksy melody. The number is sung by
            Vijay Yesudas with all the expression and superior flavor.me music, which tends to impress people, the
            moment they listen to it.
    </p>
        <p>
   "Mayya Yashoda (Thames Mix)" - Not very different from the second track,
            the song just adds up the additional rhythms and basses.
            <br />
    </p>
       <p>
  "Call Me Dil" - Rashid Ali delivers again. The opening strums did remind
            me of the opening strums of “Roobaroo” from “Rang De Basanthi”, but yes, when the
            vocal jumps in, you know they’ve nothing in common. A number with romantic attitude
            and mild female chorus along with the lead vocals. Pleasing and effective.

      Whatever may be said, whoever may criticize, it becomes evident that there is one
            man who stands on the waves of the ocean and delivers with what can be phrased as
            “Devotion and innovation”. And yet implausibly all and sundry, doesn’t comprehend
            this. Do they?
