    <h4>Synopsis: Sakkarakatti is sweet , but without the lyrics!</h4>
    <p>
       It has been raining Rahman for the past few months. After the Stupendous "Jodha
            Akbar", Peppy "Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na" and entracing "Ada" , its something that doesnt
            reach those heights but a sweet album "Sakkarakatti". I'm too impatient to review
            track by track and this is not a review but my opinion on the album.
    </p>
    <p>
       "Taxi Taxi" - "Taxi Taxi" is Finicky and Peppy. Blaaze does have his command
            over the first few lines of the song and after that its almost a typical Rahman
            song. A nice fast listen.And why is hip - hop affecting Indian music too much nowadays?
    </p>
    <p>
       "Marudaani"- would be my original pick of the album (I don't consider Chinnama
            and Yesh Rishtaa, as they belong to Rahman's own spellbinding "Meenaxi"). Sung well,
            but with bad tamil accent , which doesnt spoil the song to a noticable extent. Very
            well orchestrated, sung and again the lyrics ain't that good.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I Miss You" - "I Miss You", sung in the husky tone, din;t impress me much
            at the beginning, but then , nowadays I'm feeling its kinda good.
    </p>
    <p>
        "Yelai" - ", this must have been the most creative song of the album with
            guitar strummings and scottish tunes. But then the lyrics spoils it. I mean it.
            How long are we going to use the galaxy, antenna , telescopes...is it futuristic?
            I mean, it sounds like the lyrics is written somewhere in the 80s. And I would like
            the lyricists to undertand today's youth don't use such scientific terms. But the
            song as far the music is concerned is very impressive. It has a rahmanisque ambience
            which is what we expect. Don't we?
    </p>
  <p>
         "Nee eppodum " and "Chinnama" are the same tracks from Meenaxi. "Yeh Rishtaa" is
            one of my life time favourite track, and I din't even bother to listen it tamil.I
            donot want to spoil the image I have on the song. On the whole, "Sakkarakati" music
            may not be as sweet as sugar but surely as a sugar free sachet for the diabetics
            patients.
