      The frosted bottle looks astonishing, describing the incredible aquatic nature that the Giorgio Armani Acqua Di Gio is made to smell for. Undeniably, one of the amazing aquatic scents, Acqua Di Gio opens very citrusy with Madarin Orange, Orange, Bergamot, Neroli and a neat Jasmine.

    <p>
      What follows up next is a graceful amalgamation of Cyclamen, Nutmeg, Coriander, Peach, Violet and a rush of marine notes. The jasmine follows through the middle notes until the bottom notes of 
Amber, Patchouli Cedar and White Musk appear. None of these are very prominent, since the bottom notes are mostly feeble.

     	With a smell, that stands to be a classic, the sillage , projection and longevity are poor. Projection for the first few minutes of wearing is notable, while it fades away, just like that. But, Acqua Di Gio ‘s smell is something a wearer can be proud of. Instantly likeable,  fantastically summer, young and aquatic, Acqua Di Gio is a great fragrance, just let down by its projection parameters.
