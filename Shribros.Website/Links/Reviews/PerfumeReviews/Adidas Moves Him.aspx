        Adidas is a German athletic shoe and apparel brand. It was founded in the year 1948. They partnered with Coty (parent company of the famous Davidoff) in 1985 for the fragrance manufacture. “Moves” was launched in 1999. “Moves” top notes include the sharpness of green apple, mint and pineapple. Also, there are shades of mandarin orange and black pepper. The mint is comfortingly mild. Ginger and Cedar in contrast to the lavender, Jasmine, Geranium and musk form an interesting combination although less noticeable. But there is strong leading longevity of the base notes including a powerful sandalwood, thyme, lily-of-the-valley and oak moss. “Moves” can be considered a moderate perfume with amazing base notes that linger for a while. Great for a summer day, “Moves” is a freshly spicy, sweet, yet fresh fragrance.
