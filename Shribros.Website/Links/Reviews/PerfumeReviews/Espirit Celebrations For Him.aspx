        Esprit is an international lifestyle brand founded in 1968. Espirit released “Celebration for Him” in 2008. “Celebration” starts with a quirky synthetic note of very mild fruity scent of Pineapple and more overpowering sharp and citrusy Bergamot. There are also hints of Marine notes, but these fade away fairly quickly. The sillage is not quite as powerful as it should be. Rosemary and Lavender shines through the middle notes. There are hints of Geranium too which makes the combination mildly floral. This Eau De Toilette is not strong enough and is relatively a dull product. The freshness quotient remains feeble. The base notes of Amber and White Musk are prominent and that accounts for the pronounced masculine end. “Celebration” lasts only for a few hours and the Celebration ends right there. Suitable to be worn in cool conditions. While not the best of Espirit, “Celebration” doesn’t smell awful, just that it is mild and short lived.
