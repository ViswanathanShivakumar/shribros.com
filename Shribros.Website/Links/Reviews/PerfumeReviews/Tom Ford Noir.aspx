      Boasting notes that comprise of elements from different geographical locations, Tom Ford’s Noir, is unique in its own way. Tom Ford’s prestigious company has two line of procuding fragrance; Private Blends and the signature line. Tom Ford Noir falls into the later.
Noir opens up with a bergamot cleanly creamed with vanilla. It is also darkly green. Not very appealing at the opening, it turns into rose, amber and more prominent civet. Also, surfaced with Pepper, Patchouli and Geranium, Tom Ford Noir is a perfume, that needs to certainly be tried before buy. But it is not exciting as it could’ve been. Noir is just dark and doesn’t completely live up to its name.
The lasting time and projection are little disappointing, for Noir is quite expensive. But, Noir is not bad; it is just too experimental at a perfumista’s expense.
