       Reebok Reecharge has one of the most invigoratingly fresh scents, with a burst of green grass, mint and eucalyptus as the start. It is fresh and powerful, but quickly moves on to a weaker sillage. The opening surely reminds us of the superb, universally loved Calvin Klein Eternity. Faintly citrus notes offer us crisp and clean notes. The sillage after ten minutes of application fades away, stays very close to skin on dry down. Also the longevity is considerably poor. But Reebok Reecharge, while short is lived is one of the most inexpensive EDTs that can be one of the best options for a casual evening wear and best for sports folks.
