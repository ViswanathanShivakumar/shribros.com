    <h2><span class="BrandName">Park Avenue </span>Zing</h2>
    <img src="<%=ResolveClientUrl("AdidasMovesHim.jpg") %>" />
    <p>
        Park Avenue’s “Zing” belongs to the signature collection. It opens with a very Fruity and floral note combined seamlessly with mild aquatic undertone. Although the Fruity and floral note and chocolate might be on the feminine side, there is slide edge of masculine fragrance, possibly a few spicy notes. The deodorant frangrance reminded me of Shirley May “Cross” for Men.The aquatic tone brings out the freshness, while the spicy notes pep up the intensity. Unlike the normal Park Avenue collection, which leaves a hint of powdery fragrance towards the end, the signature collection stays the way it is.The fragrance lasts for around 9-10 hours on a normal skin and might be ideal for winter or cool conditions.

    <h2><span class="BrandName">Park Avenue </span>Terra</h2>
    <img src="<%=ResolveClientUrl("AdidasMovesHim.jpg") %>" />
    <p>
        Park Avenue’s “Terra” is a woody fragrance that settles down to a sharp sandalwood and carnation note. While it starts with a perfectly masculine spicy note tinted with Balsamic notes, which even smell slightly of soap, Terra is mild. The soapy and oriental scent might not get everyone’s liking, but Terra is Ideal for summer conditions. Towards the end it leaves a powdery note and lingers for a long time (at least 6-7 hours).

    <a name="Park Avenue Alter Ego"></a>
    <h2><span class="BrandName">Park Avenue </span>Alter Ego</h2>
    <img src="<%=ResolveClientUrl("AdidasMovesHim.jpg") %>" />
    <p>
        Park Avenue’s “Alter Ego” grabs you with a classy, yet modern top note. Possibly black currant and mostly fruity at the top and heart notes, the fragrance brings up a very fresh feeling, while also overwhelming enormous sometimes. With Woody and a very mild musky tone at the base, “Alter Ego” has a very good longevity and sillage. “Alter Ego” belongs to the signature collection and surely deserves its place.

    <h2><span class="BrandName">Park Avenue </span>Horizon</h2>
    <img src="<%=ResolveClientUrl("AdidasMovesHim.jpg") %>" />
    <p>
        Park Avenue’s “Horizon” is one of the freshest smelling woody aquatic deodorant of the Park Avenue classic family. But it also has very soapy smelling notes. The fragrance is mild, sweet and has tints of leather too. A touch masculine, the longevity is not as much as other Park Avenue deodorants. Authentic, but not for anyone who might hate the soapy notes, that overshadow the base fragrance at the beginning.<br />
        P.S. The product is not discontinued by Park Avenue.

    <h2><span class="BrandName">Park Avenue </span>Yeti</h2>
    <img src="<%=ResolveClientUrl("AdidasMovesHim.jpg") %>" />
    <p>
        Park Avenue “Yeti” is a bad deodorant. In terms of smell, it is just fine with the minty note, but it tries to be a winter deodorant with the wet sticky castor oil based moisturizing component. I found it irritating for a deodorant. ”Yeti” tries to be innovative and fails.

    <h2><span class="BrandName">Park Avenue </span>Imagine</h2>
    <img src="<%=ResolveClientUrl("AdidasMovesHim.jpg") %>" />
    <p>
        Park Avenue “Imagine” reminds me of Park Avenue’s own “Alter Ego” with the opening notes. Its wildly fruity at the beginning and has a very warm woody note when it ends. The deodorant smell stays for quite a long time and has good effective sillage too. It is fresh and effective. This is a newly introduced deodorant (Jan 2014?).

    <p>
        Another new entry, Park Avenue “Believe” has a superb fragrance, subtle and fresh.The floral notes seamlessly merge with aquatic notes are energizing and effervescent. The base notes are cedar and sandalwoods, which perfectly match the top notes on dry down. The sillage is a touch weak, but has good longevity.

    <a name="Park Avenue Alive"></a>
    <h2><span class="BrandName">Park Avenue </span>Alive</h2>
    <img src="<%=ResolveClientUrl("AdidasMovesHim.jpg") %>" />
    <p>
        “Alive” is a messy deodorant in the Park Avenue’s signature collection. The smell is quite synthetic as it opens and has a very short longevity. It stays close to skin most of the times. The opening notes are synthetically fruity and turns out to musk. A very weak addition to the signature collection, which has a classic line up that includes, “Voyage”, “Alter-Ego” and “Zing”
