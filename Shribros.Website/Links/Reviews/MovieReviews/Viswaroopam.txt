I say this is a perfect review!!! I felt the same pain going through the movie. Technically good, logically insane.

Disappointed with the review Sriram. This seems more a rant than an objective review. This would be more suited as a commentary on Vishwaroopam than a review of it. <br/><br/>I am not disagreeing with the overall suggestion that it is technically good but flawed in a lot of ways. I came back from the movie thinking the same that this could ve been a lot better movie by just changing a few scenes. Kamal seems to have wanted to make a taut, so-called international standard(hollywood seems to be his only inspiration here) action thriller but midway got cold-feet and decided to add a few safe-scenes for the Indian audience.. However I am going off-topic here about my criticism of the review.<br/><br/>How is "An agent trimming his hair in the midst of a bomb crisis to look better...taking his wife around when trying to diffuse a bomb...racing NYPD cars in the midst of Manhattan" crappy direction?? Crappy writing maybe if you feel that way but it can be crappy direction only if it wasn;t shot well. The car bursting out of the wall-apart:P I think the chase was decently shot. I actually loved the way the movie was directed. Kamal the director has been let-down by Kamal the writer and 'KAMAL-the big-egoed actor'.<br/><br/>Another simple example of inconsistency in the review -  " But one must admit that there only very few in Tamil Cinema who can even pull off this kind of a movie." which seems to imply this is definitely slightly(however infinitesimal) ahead of the curve for Tamil cinema. But the review states later - 'Writing and Directing a movie of Vishwaroopam cadre does not even take Tamil cinema anywhere close to international standards'. So, which is it?<br/><br/>You guys write brilliant reviews and I don't comment on them, please take my silence as satisfaction:P. But if I feel that anything is not up to mark, I want to make sure to let you guys know. It is up to you guys to take it or leave it. <br/><br/>Cheers

Can you guys organise this as per year of release or artist rather than alphabetically? Just a suggestion..

Spoiler alert!!!<br/><br/>To start with there is always the difference in opinion on a movie's standard between people. The review presented here is that of mine. I understand that you have liked the movie and the so called "rant" may have been disappointing. I intended to write a review here, but if appears to be a rant, that's how the movie was.<br/><br/>"...but midway got cold-feet and decided to add a few safe-scenes for the Indian audience.. "<br/><br/>Right there he failed. Compromises kill a movie and from Kamal Hassan I do not expect a compromise that will make the movie look funny. I expect it from Vijay and Vijaykanth who fight the terrorist forces just by themselves. At least they don't tend to use names where they were trained and stuff which makes it look a little less funnier.<br/><br/>"Crappy writing maybe if you feel that way but it can be crappy direction only if it wasn't shot well"<br/><br/>Direction is not about carrying a camera around an shooting the movie as written in the screenplay book. It is more. A movie cannot be directionally good with a bad story and screenplay. I believe it's the basic. To add more and dive deep, the first 20 minutes of the movie with Vishwanathan, the undercover identity acts with intelligence on par with a normal person or sometimes even below. He seems to ask for what to do when someone else is following him. Gets beaten up badly amidst the fact that he can collapse a whole army single handedly. All this sequenced to bring out the cheap heroic fight that follows. To make it more clear, the fight was shot very well but the unwanted waste of scenes to bring out the heroism and narration was silly. I could have agreed with this delivery if he later does not bring in real names like "al-qaeda" and Indian army. When you related to actual organizations, do justice to it. I don't expect an agent of Indian Army to take his wife along for diffusing a bombs. I just though "crappy" was a strong term, with this said, now it looks more appropriate. There are a thousand sequence that sparks in my mind, just running short of time and use for it.<br/><br/>"The car bursting out of the wall-apart:P I think the chase was decently shot"<br/><br/>I did mentioned that the action sequences were made well. But this car chase again looked illogical. A terrorist capable of blowing New York city, gets into a car rally on the streets of Manhattan and so easily goes off the radar of NYPD? In the first few scenes, dialogues gives details of the cold weather and "pneumonia" and so on. If he can concentrate on such minute details (which sometime looked to me as band aids trying to cover the incomparable holes in the story and screenplay), do you think NYPD or a terrorist would play racing on Manhattan streets?<br/><br/>"I actually loved the way the movie was directed. Kamal the director has been let-down by Kamal the writer and 'KAMAL-the big-egoed actor'."<br/><br/>A director always has total control over the movie. That is the reason all credits of a movie first goes to its director. Do you think the writer over ruled the director. If he did, again the movie and director have failed together. Kamal has made a silly movie with grand decoration and lets face the fact in spite of the fact that he is an all time favorite and one with immense capability and skill.<br/><br/>"Another simple example of inconsistency in the review"<br/><br/>There does not seem to be an inconsistency here. But will make it more elaborate. The first comment signifies the scale, money and the cast involved in the movie which is way beyond what the Tamil industry can easily achieve. Kamal is one of the few who can just not think about making a movie which is shot across the globe with top notch actors but can also achieve it. The later one is simply self explanatory, he just did not make what he boasts of, the so called "international standard". If doing a preview on Los Angeles down town was what he meant, I agree to his words.<br/><br/>Thanks again mate!
