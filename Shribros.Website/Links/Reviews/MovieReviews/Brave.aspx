    <h4>Synopsis: “Brave” is fabulous, beautiful and entertaining, but just not brave enough.</h4>
    <p>
        “Brave”, this year’s Pixar offering is more of a Disney fable. It is beautiful, simple, heartfelt, thrilling, but just not audacious enough. It is like a sweet dream. A couple of years before, I used to bet my head on all the Pixar offerings to win the best animated picture Oscar. But regrettably, since last year, I didn’t dare to do that and it hurts me to say that.

        “Brave” follows Merida (Kelly McDonald), a princess, who is strong-minded to make her own destination in life. She is a skilled archer and the daughter of King Fergus (Billy Connolly) and Queen Elinor (Emma Thompson). When granted a wish, a disastrous one, it changes her life. The movie is as simple as the story, with amazing visuals of gorgeous Scotland’s landscapes and soulful music. Although, the screenplay plays it very safe (which to Pixar’s soaring standards is a crime), it is far better than any other movie at the market this year.

        Lushly rendered images, vivid, detailed animation, emotional and often hilarious, Brave is a marked with directional skills of Mark Andrews and Brenda Chapman (who conceived the idea). The all girl heroic story is a notable adventure story, which is as dark as it could get in an animation movie and is filled in with magic and humanity. The ending is very much conventional and the movie is devoid of the classy WALL E opening or the Toy Story 3 finale.

        “Brave” is a great watch and a superb entertainer, but it just not brave enough for Pixar’s standards. All I wish for is that Pixar’s 2013 release, “Monsters University” does what its sequel “Monsters Inc.”, did not. Win the Oscar. “La Luna” the short that is shown before the movie, is one of the most innovative, poignant and beautiful shorts of Pixar. Do not miss it.
