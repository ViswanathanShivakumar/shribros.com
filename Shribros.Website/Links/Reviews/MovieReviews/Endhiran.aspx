    <h4>Synopsis: Shankar hasn’t wasted money but should have worked on a better script.</h4>
    <p>
        Before I start let me tell you about the ambience in the theater. It was the first
            day first show of ‘Endhiran’ and it was no different from any of the crowd you will
            find in Indian theaters. There were tons of papers thrown in front of the screen.
            I could barely see anything on the screen for a few scenes including Rajni’s introduction
            which was very simple unlike his usual movies and when the title “Super star” went
            on the screen. There were small wind instruments creating annoying sound all around.
            The best thing was a few people gathered and lit camphor in front of the screen
            when the movie started. Dancing in front of the screen and screaming went almost
            all through the movie. It was almost like watching the first show in India.

        It’s hard to review a Rajnikanth movie. More than movie making skills it’s the Rajni
            phenomenon that will satisfy. There are two perceptions. Let me start with the interpretation
            of a normal movie viewer. The movie did not have the so called ‘Rajni factor’ at
            all. Shankar is reputed for his pace in his movies. After about 20 minutes I could
            very much feel the sluggishness. A few scenes were even at times uninteresting and
            isolated from the story. There were lots of scenes which had “Shankar style” Viz.
            Rajni morphing with metal pieces into Goddess Kali like figure, the fight inside
            a train, last few scenes and subtle comedies.

        Sujatha’s dialogues need a special mention. You would find lots of sarcastic comments
            from ‘Chitti’ character that triggers a laugh but are on a serious note in the movie
            flow. Sujatha’s involvement is also realized from the technical details in dialogues
            that are exactly relevant unlike most of the movies which give crap and funny specifications.
            Aishwarya Rai has done great job with dance in almost every song especially in “Irumbilae...”
            Rajni has showcased good skills of acting in every character. I specifically liked
            the antagonist role which comes on screen only towards the end of the movie. Long
            time since we’ve seen him playing against the hero. I definitely need to speak about
            the scene which I most disliked when Rajni tries to impress Aishwarya by speaking
            to a mosquito and taking it to her. Though it was meant to add a comical fabrication
            to the story, it was completely unnecessary and annoying. It was funny but unappreciable.

        So I’m watching the most expensive movie in India and where did all the money go?
            It all concentrated towards the climax sequences. This is the best visual effects
            sequence I’ve ever watched in an Indian movie covering over 30 minutes completely.
            In many of the scenes the effects are very fine to be perceived as artificial. Especially
            when a whole place is guarded with the Robotic version of Rajnikanth and the prime
            Robot (bad version of Chitti) takes Aishwarya through the place. It was almost equivalent
            to any good standard VFX. There were also few effects that were not up to the mark
            which was tolerable. I particularly enjoyed the snake formation of the cloned Rajini’s.
            It is evident that Shankar has struggled to achieve the technical details and a
            full blown visual effects movie is a huge task for an Indian director. He has delivered
            his best within the limits of an Indian movie economy.

        Ok now! Looking at the movie from a viewer who knows what “Rajini” means and the
            Indian movie market. The movie does not meet the expectations but satifies. Shankar
            sweeps off the mind with the final sequence which will fill your head as we walk
            out of the theater. One must always hold it in mind that this is a regional language
            movie from India spending millions. You don’t expect the director to deliver a movie
            like “AI” or “Star Trek”. There will be commercial factors including fight and music
            which may look odd in the movie flow but will keep coming which we need to accept.
            I could not believe that there were no punch dialogues or hypes for Rajni in the
            movie. The commercial aspects were kept to minimum. It almost delivers a 75% satisfying
            entertainer to all Rajni fans and less than that for a Shankar movie. Thumbs up
            to Shankar for the great try!
