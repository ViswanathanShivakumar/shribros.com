That is no surprise.  SNL is doing this for viwsheip purposes.  It had a hit with Palin and now it hopes to have a hit with McCain BUT to add a twist by having Affleck as the host.  Even if Affleck was to say something liberal and provocative to McCain (which I am sure he will) that is NOT going to turn voters off from Obama.  McCain dug his own grave by using running a negative campaign and using Joe the Plumber as his  grace from fall .  By the way did you see that Joe the Plumber was a No Show at a recent McCain rally!
