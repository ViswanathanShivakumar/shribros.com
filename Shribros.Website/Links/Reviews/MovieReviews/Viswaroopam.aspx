    <h4>Synopsis:“Vishwaroopam” is uninvolving and self depreciating.</h4>
    <p>
            When I start writing a review on a movie, I attempt to be as impartial as possible 
            and I always do justice to my cinematic perception. Just before I commence the
             review of Kamal Haasan’s latest directorial venture, the mega budget “Vishwaroopam”, 
             I  wish to give a preamble on the mindset of the Indian audience on Hollywood standard 
             of film making and for a good reason. While we could deal with the reason the later part of this article,
              I’ve heard a lot of my friends and pals comparing many of the mainstream Indian movies with Hollywood.
               Well, there is nothing immoral doing so, since Hollywood has set a baseline for a superlative standard, 
               which can even be debated when it comes to artistic sense.
                But the major aspect that the audience take into consideration is the budget that is being involved, 
                the action sequences, and scenes that make their jaws drop. Whilst, this seems to be only a very small part
                 of the movies that come out of Hollywood (which includes all English speaking movies from Britain, Australia etc, for the above set of audience), the other major part is a in fact a critic loving genre of movies. But, let us only regard the first part of the Hollywood that the world in reality knows about. There is a quotient of sensibility attached to it, which might be either remain, low or high, according to the movies themselves. Now, this sensibility that exists in many of those films should be taken into account when a comparison is made. This sensibility internally accounts for the quality of the movie. International standard doesn’t really live in the budget or the level in which the action sequences are made, but this particular quotient that I was ranting about. I do not fault the audience, but indisputably our should society get a coverage to the “real” standards and then talk about comparisons. Just shooting the movie in New York is not being a Hollywood movie.

        Kamal Haasan’s “Vishwaroopam” is an interesting enterprise because 
            it made me think on a man, who was once the ray of hope for Tamil cinema
             and was considered as a man who could make films, with even low budget 
             (examples like “Mahanadi” is worth mentioning) to international standards.
              Now, this evolution of the man I’m speaking about, Kamal, to a more non-contemplative 
              and middle-of-the-road crisis driven human being, is all the more sub-standard.
               He has directed a couple of fantastic movies that are “really” international 
               (talking about “Hey Ram” and “Virumaandi”), although with trivial flaws. I wish Kamal,
                was trying to set right his flaws of his earlier attempts rather than moving on to make more
                 superficial, shallow, and self heroic action entertainers. Now, that he has preferred the focus
                  of an action entertainer, I expected him to stick to the sensibilities connected with it. 
                  There are good mainstream entertainers and no brainers that give us guilty pleasure
                   of watching them and deeply succeed in doing so. But, a pseudo intelligent shot at 
                   juxtaposing, the entertainment with a purportedly message-driven value of a film is not
                    for a man of this calibre. “Vishwaroopam” failed, even as a guilty pleasure 
                    movie to me because of the above mentioned dim-witted and pseudo-shrewd idea.

         Kamal Haasan as an actor is just great and no one would doubt it.
            He lights up the movie, on all right notes principally with his entry as the dancer.
             The first few minutes, the best part of the movie (movie alone), kicks off well and adequately plotted.
              But all good ends right after the QT-Rodriguez-Guy Ritchie, styled stunt scene,
               which was well choreographed. Right after that, be it in Afghanistan or New York, it is a downhill trip. 
               Unremittingly uninvolving screenplay, messy characterization of the protagonist himself, 
               follows throughout. There were a few fortunately nicely directed moments 
               (including the execution of the alleged traitor), that again were eclipsed by
                more than enough preposterous scenes and irrelevant interventions including the
                 talks on Kamal's usual theory of God and existentialism. I would like to brief more on that 
                 “messy characterization” part. A movie’s character should be a character which fits to the movie alone.
                  Satire can be a part of a single movie, which theme can fit in to the character 
                  and theme of the movie. As a basic character build, a protagonist who gives works in espionage
                   environment, cannot reveal his emotions in front of the group he tries to fit in.
                    Involving in actions that directly notifies the enemy that the character does not belong 
                    to the group is rationally being dumb. While, I understand the hero is good hearted he is 
                    allowed to do so, personally and not in public. It is sheer common sense, even for a commercial
                     mainstream mass entertainer. That was just an instance and Kamal disheartens us in many such moments.
    </p>

        The BGM helps the movie and Shankar Ehsaan Loy didn’t disappoint. The cast is surely talented, 
            but mostly wasted, including the ever incredible Nasser and Shekar Kapoor. Rahul Bose is a great actor,
             but despondently fails as Omar and for the first time, a director has underused him trying to 
             underplay too much, for his talent. Technically, it’s not an achievement, but pleasing enough, 
             though the freeze frames were quite an unnecessary gimmick work. The car chases were way too chaotic.
              The new comer Pooja does it well, and Andrea does her part well too. As in any other Indian movie,
               weak Hollywood actors do their minor parts, inadequately, except the one who plays the commanding FBI agent. 
               It is pointless to search for answers to questions on logic, since it is unimportant anyways. 
               Too much hard work has surely gone into this. Many scenes had intricate details, but one might wonder 
               what is the point in having too many details for a scene that is too absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
         And not to forget the final moment, where all the four major characters walk in parallel, 
           as Kamal gives straight forward note on the sequel as an answer to the absurdly pointless statement from Pooja.
            I did note that Shekar Kapur at the right corner of the screen, grinning ashamedly to that petty talk. 
            So, did I, because, I exactly knew the reason. 
    </p>
     <p>
         The good thing about “Viswaroopam” is that I liked it better than Ravikumar directed “Dasavatharam”. 
               “Vishwaroopam” might have been intended to the mass deprived of authentic good quality movies for a while. 
               Well, luckily I’m not into that scarcity, yet.

    <h4>Synopsis:Over ambitions venture of Kamal Haasan hitting a mediocre mark</h4>
    <p>
               Kamal Haasan, my personal favourite of all time, 
               falls into the trap of not finding a balance between commercial and high quality movie making. 
               In his fourth directional venture, “Ulaga Nayagan” Kamal Haasan exhausts all his efforts, 
               yet drains out with explicit flaws. But one must admit that 
               there only very few in Tamil Cinema who can even pull off this kind of a movie.
    </p>
    <p>
       Most of the movie is set in New York and 
       very well cinematographed. As expected the protagonist shows up in various styles 
       of looks and does justice to each. Thanks to Kamal for sticking to changes in facial hairs
        and hairstyles unlike Dasavatharam with pathetic make-up. Mr. Haasan seems to be obsessed 
        with the Tam-Bram dialect and awkwardly fits it into his movies. So does this movie open up with
         dialogues of the same dialect. Multiple scenes have been designed in sequence to bring out heroism 
         all around the movie. Action sequences are done well and Kamal has not shown any constraints with spending 
         his own money. 
    </p>
    <p>
                    Haasan’s excellence of direction shown in “Hey Ram” and “Virumandi” does not pop up even
                     in fragments anywhere in this movie. An agent trimming his hair in the midst of a bomb
                      crisis to look better...taking his wife around when trying to diffuse a bomb...racing 
                      NYPD cars in the midst of Manhattan...give me a break...heights of crappy direction.
                       At this point of his career, the degree of expectation from Kamal is very high. 
                       Delivering a movie that is so unclassy, Kamal seems to be running backward with his 
                       maturity of thoughts towards movie making. Vishwaroopam would have brought Kamal acclaims
                        if it was made 15 years back.

    </p>
    <p>
                   I am sure Tamil Cinema was pinning trust on this man to take it to international acclaim. 
                   With Dasavadharam, Kamal ruined most of it which was at least acceptable with a third person direction. 
                   Writing and Directing a movie of Vishwaroopam cadre does not even take Tamil cinema anywhere close to 
                   international standards. Mere shooting of the film in foreign lands does not bring any honor. 
                   Kamal must strictly cut down pushing his personal ideologies including atheism into dialogues at
                    irrelevant situations. This is most prevalent in all his movies which all the more draw the movie 
                    into the pit.

    </p>
    <p>
                   There is careful detailing of every scene which is appreciable. 
                   But they don’t even make a mark with a flawed storyline. Making a movie 
                   is not about proving the director’s knowledge of the world but in delivering a 
                   good movie and including only what is necessary. Though the movie shows up to have a grandiose plot, 
                   it is based out of a cheesy story that has been around for long and ending in the most expected style 
                   seen in every other Indian movie.

    </p>
     <p>
The writer has used real terrorist organization names all through the movie and deliberately uses
 relevant real time characters names too. Mimicking the most wanted terrorist of all time was well 
 handled but as the movie progresses, the concepts of anti-terrorism or any good idea that the director tried 
 to portray becomes meaningless and get drowned in his own heroism. Towards the end of the movie, a teaser of the part 
 2 is shown. Nothing much to comment until the movie is in theaters. But I set my expectation to zero so that it does not 
 look as bad as it really is.
