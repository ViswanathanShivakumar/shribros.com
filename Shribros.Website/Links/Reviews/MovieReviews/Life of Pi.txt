Thanks for the article. The sanesds and indignation is that this tragedy is something that could have been avoided. This is different from the one that happened in the U.S.True, the sanesds is that we haven't tried to avoid something which can be avoided, because we think it is hard to avoid. Indeed, cheap products, cheap lives.
