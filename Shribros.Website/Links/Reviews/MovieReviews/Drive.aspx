    <h4>Synopsis: Refn and Gosling astonish the audience with a brutal thriller.</h4>
    <p>
        No body can uncover, what the “Driver” thinks; neither from his staring, non-blinking cold expressionless face, nor from his one worded talks. But all we know about him at the end of the film is that he will do anything for love and he is very very violent. That’s pretty much, how I would sum up Nicolas Winding Refn’s stylish art factory movie “Drive”. The movie is all about the driver’s (played by Ryan Gosling) character.

    <p>
        A gifted driver (stunt performer and mechanic by profession) ,whose involvement in small time crimes and the beautiful neighbour (Carey Mulligan),  lands him in to mess. It would inescapably place him under circumstances, where he has to either run for his life or has to kill down the foes in the Micheal Corleone way. The movie has astounding performances from the lead, Ryan Gosling followed closely by Carey and Albert Brooks.

        Somehow, the movie closely reminded me of David Cronenberg’s “A History of violence”, not only in its gory violence, but also in the eccentric characterization. But, Refn’s pacy direction and the artistic association, is where the “Drive” begins to stand out. Marvelously crafted, musically enriched and vibrantly cinematographed, with its heart pounding slow motions, the movie stands tall, all the way. Markedly, the only miniscule black patch, I wish I hadn’t seen, is the ease in which the driver wipes out the big heads. Well, no big deal.

        “Drive” is stylish, brutal and artistic. When one might credit the sleek and shrewd direction of Refn, it is also Gosling, who makes, “Drive” a fantastic piece of taut thriller. The director gives you an hour and thirty odd minutes window, anything that happens during that time; we are his, no matter what.
