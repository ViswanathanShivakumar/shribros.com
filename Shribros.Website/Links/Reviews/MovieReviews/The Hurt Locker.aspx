    <h4>Synopsis:  Best of Iraq War movies</h4>
    <p>
            I haven’t watched any of Kathryn Bigelow’s films yet. ‘The Hurt Locker” was my first
            and I’m impressed. This is one of the very few films that have all the ingredients
            of war, emotions associated with it and life, in the recent times. “The Hurt Locker”
            is daunting, powerful and quite suspenseful at every moment.

         “The Hurt Locker’ is about the chaos in Baghdad and particularly about the US army
            bomb squad. The story revolves around the Bravo Company’s bomb disposal unit; with
            US Army Staff Sergeant Will James, Sergeant Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge.
            The Thirty nine days of this company’s attempts with success and failure of disposing
            bombs around Baghdad is “The Hurt Locker”.

       Jeremy Renner as SSgt. Will James is a cool, pretty experienced Bomb diffuser, who
            has differences with his own team Sgt. Sanborn, for his attitude makes Sanborn bothered.
            Jeremy Renner, with all his abilities makes the character, wonderful to watch. The
            movie doesn’t over-dramatize the war, as Ridley Scott’s ‘Black hawk down’ does.
            We know its war, and we see the chaos in front of our eyes, how everyday of life
            is blemished, so wretchedly.

       The cinematography by Barry Ackroyd makes the movie riveting. Kathryn Bigelow’ achievement
            is not just in the perfect dramatization of the war, but in the few moments of the
            film like, when the boy who sells DVD to the soldiers, gets ripped for the body
            bomb or when the bombs are tied around a family man in the center of the market
            and Sgt.James says after his attempts to save him, says “Sorry”.
    </p>
    <p>
      The film is very true to its subject and characterization and achieves at every
            level of directional perfection. “The Hurt Locker” might have to be watched out
            for this year’s Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Editing and
            Best Cinematography. But even if it doesn’t make it there, it has already made into
            the list of Best War movies.
