I Consider still The prestige and the dark knight best of nolan,movie doesnt fall short of anywhere both technically and artwise and acting too.Dialogues tone here that doesnt suited the story may be it will work only with his brother jonathan nolan.Acting doesnt have any scope at all so cant complain on this part :).Nolan made every one to dream for 2hrs 30 mins.
