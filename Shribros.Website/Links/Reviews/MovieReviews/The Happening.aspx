    <h4>Synopsis: "The Happening" is not so bad!</h4>
    <p>
     You can see the critics tearing it apart. The reviews say ,the movie showcases end
            of a career.Is "The Happening" really so bad?
    </p>
    <p>
         I'm a kinda critical viewer and believe me the movie is not that bad ,but it is
            highly flawed. It should have a had a plot. But still the movie has a lotta chilling
            moments and thats the reason why you go to watch a Shyamalan movie.Isn't it?
    </p>
    <p>
       The acting is bad;Music is awesome and so is the cinematography; Dialogues are pretty
            bad though. Yes, the theme is good, but the movie embraces a lot of moments from
            other Doomsday movies , esp. War of the worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
        Why don't Shyamalan leave Philadephia and shoot his movie somewhere else. This is
            not a bad movie and I hope the critics don't end his career. Give him a few more
            chances.
    </p>
    <p>
        Watch "The Happening" for the atmospheric chilling moments.
