    <h4>Synopsis: Vijay concentrates only on the details and loses an opportunity to create an epic.</h4>
    <p>
          “Chennai” as it is called now was only a few years before called “Madras” , which
            in turn was derived from the name “Madarasapatinam”. Now, Vijay, the director of
            the new Tamil feature with the same name, has lofty ambitions and notice to minute
            particulars, but not the imagination for a change from the good old stories of inter
            racial love.
    </p>
    <p>
           The movie’s storyline revolves around the granny Amy, who along with her grand daughter
            travels back to Chennai (Madarasapatinam) ,to find her lover (of course, when she
            was young (Amy Jackson)), Parithi (Arya) to return him back something that she has
            with her. The movie interlaces both the present and the past synchronously to make
            us comprehend the whole span of the century. It works out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The detailing is pretty fabulous. You can see all those Narasus’ Coffee banners
            on trams , the old fashioned Amruthanjans on the bed and so on. Also looks good.
            Nirav shah’s job is well done, especially on the chase sequences. Vijay’s screenplay
            works out well in the first part of the movie, where we tend to look out for humor
            and our attention is more on details. But later, this becomes a draggy progression
            of chases after the lovers, interrupted by the songs.
    </p>
    <p>
            It was quite inevitable to compare the first song sequence with the first in the
            acclaimed Hindi feature “Lagaan”. So similar was the fashion. As far as songs and
            the background music, G V Prakash’s has done his part pretty upright.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, Vijay’s eye has a finicky strength in the details and dialogues, wherein he
            incorporates his point of view of the political arena. But then he should have had
            a wide angle to have performed well with the storyline and the nearly predictable
            screenwriting.
    </p>
    <p>
        Certainly I do appreciate Vijay for his superb shot, only that if the plot was further
            different, it would’ve been a great movie.
