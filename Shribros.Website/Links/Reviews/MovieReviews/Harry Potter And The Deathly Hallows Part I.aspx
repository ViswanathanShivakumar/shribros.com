    <h4>Synopsis: These are dark times, Harry!</h4>

    <p>
        The story is now built. The foundation is very well in place. We are marching towards
            the finale, the grander one. David Yates sets up a darker installment prior to the
            decisive battle between Harry Potter and the Dark Lord. This penultimate episode
            of the Harry Potter series is a adroitly crafted film.
    </p>
    <p>
        It casts the same ensemble, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint , who
            carry out their task as good as in any chapter of the series and every now and then
            ,even better. There is a scene, where the three friends masquerade themselves to
            trick the wicked people at Hogwarts. It is amusing. This is the difference from
            the previous episode, Half Blood prince, which was frightfully dark.
    </p>
    <p>
        David Yates makes this more of thrill and fun together, which is principally the
            spirit of the Harry Potter series. The fascinating cinematography picks up the darker
            times with exactitude. But there is one of the scenes at the beginning of the movie,
            that faintly confuses the audience with its editing. It is the chase by the”death
            eaters”.
    </p>
    <p>
        As in Half Blood prince, we do not have a thematic ending to the movie, which certainly
            doesn’t deceive the audience, but leaves us only with a longing for the grandeur,
            that might be waiting around the corner. The script is shrewd and shrewd enough
            to make it enthralling and pleasing. Lord Voldermort is seen very recurrently than
            in the other episodes and yes, he has to. It’s his game towards the closing stages.
    </p>
    <p>
        And not to miss mentioning about the impressive two dimensional animation on the
            story of the deathly hallows. It goes around for about ten minutes and these moments
            are fantastic. It makes a difference. 
    </p>
    <p>
        David Yates makes the Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows with style and superlative
            pacing. Definitely, the prelude to the end of one of the greatest fantasy movie
            series, the Part I is a hint of what is in store. Let’s wait and see the darkness
            shatter away in the final episode. I haven’t read the book yet. I don’t know what
            is going to happen. All I know is its going to be as terrific in David Yates hands.
            Harry and Dave; you guys are going to have a tough time ahead.
