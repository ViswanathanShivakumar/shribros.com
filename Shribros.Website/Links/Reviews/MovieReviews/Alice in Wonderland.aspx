                Synopsis: An enjoyable, yet incomplete adaptation by the “dark” director</h4>
            <p>
            Millions of people around the world have enjoyed the taste of Lewis Caroll’s fantasy
            masterpiece, “Alice in wonderland”. There had been too many literary and cinematic
            adaptations of the same classic. But time does never take away the freshness and
            purity of the novel. This time around , Tim Burton, who is known for his dark tales
            in the past two decades, moves his stake towards Caroll’s classic along with the
            same author’s “Looking through the glass”. All he manages is a visual entertainer.

            Alice, fantastically portrayed by Mia Wasikowska, as we all know follows the rabbit
            with the watch and falls into a rabbit hole, to find the wonderland of her dreams.
            She meets the Hatter, played by none other than Burton’s favourite , the ever charistmatic,
            Johnny Depp. Hatter isn’t much of a character like Jack Sparrow, but is played well
            within the limits by the style icon. The ‘White queen” played by the appealing Anne
            Hathaway doesn’t have a great role to play, but what she does, she does it to perfection
            and we all know she would after her riveting performance in yesteryear’s “Rachel
            Getting married”.
            </p><p>
            
            The movie is visually thoroughly engaging and inventive and doesn’t feature senseless
            action. We don’t have a “Sweeney Todd” or a “Sleepy Hollow” Burton here, but the
            one with a natural potential to see bright things even. The direction keeps the
            audience engaging, and for a summer movie goer, it’s a splendid treat, but Burton’s
            finesse artistry is surely missed on very many occasions. Though not a honest adaptation,
            there is not much to complain.
            </p><p>
            The wonderland, Alice lands in is wonder filled but threatening. But its panic driven
            areas are predictable, which brings us to the fact that, they are not thoroughly
            panic driven. Burton sure gives “Alice in Wonderland” a superior go, but just without
            filling in more directorial finesse </p>
