    <h2>Dawn of the Planet of the Apes | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       Once upon a time, “Planet of the apes” series was nothing much to talk about, after the first few movies. With the advent of the reboot, “Rise of the planet of the apes”, the whole thing changed. Its sequel, “Dawn of the planet of the apes”, roots the series to a deeper soil, with its terrific craft. Despite the fact that it not as inventive as the former, “Dawn” rests on the shoulders of godfather-ish Cesar, played with outright charisma by Andy Serkis and the iniquitous Koba, played by Toby Kebbell. Clever direction by Matt Reeves, and smart storytelling, makes “Dawn of the planet of the apes”, an outstanding entertainer and  a thriller, overriding the clichés and paving way for the next episode.

    <h2>Drug War | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Johnnie To’s “Drug War” is an intelligent, tense and well-constructed action thriller. With drugs as the center of the story, the movie unfolds in to a pattern of efficient and intelligently plotted story telling. With a violent and action packed finale, “Drug War” is a fine film by the Hong Kong action master.

     <a name="Dallas Buyers Club"></a>
    <h2>Dallas Buyers Club | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
       “Dallas Buyers Club” is completely an actor’s film that rests itself on the tremendously inspiring performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Based on the true life story of the AIDS diagnosed cowboy Ron Woodruf, the movie is uplifting and character driven. Jean-Marc Vallée’s crisp direction and very good supporting performances make Dallas Buyers Club a remarkable movie.

       <a name="Deep Impact"></a>
    <h2>Deep Impact | 1998
    </h2>
    <p>
       “Deep Impact” could’ve been a very good disaster movie. Nevertheless, it is safely not a bad movie. At the end, it is emotive, visually good and very Hollywoodish, “Deep Impact” is not a dull film. But it could’ve got more wits and courage. Tea Loni is just fine as Jenny Lerner as so is Robert Duvall and Elijah Wood in their particular roles.  “Deep Impact”, definitely is better and reasonable than its same year counterpart, “Armageddon” on the same subject.

    <a name="Dial M For Murder"></a>
    <h2>Dial M For Murder | 1954
    </h2>
    <p>
      Alfred Hitchcock’s “Dial M for Murder” is exactly what you’d come to expect of him. Completely suspenseful, immediately electrifying and cunningly witty. With a sinister role by Ray Miland, this crime exercise, enthralls and deeply enjoyable. “Dial M for Murder” which is based on a play by Frederick Knott is a classic thriller with Hitchcock playing around with sequences and consequences. The setting up and revealing of the plot within the movie itself is comparable to the director’s act, while the latter triumphs.
