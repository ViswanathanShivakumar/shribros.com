     <a name="Fury"></a>
    <h2>Fury | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>David Ayer’s “Fury” is well intentioned and an ambitious film. It is also exquisitely cinematographed to capture the horrors of war. Brad Pitt’s charisma is unequivocally remarkable and the movie itself is as raw as his emotions. It is unflinching, yet reminds us of what Steven Spielberg had to offer in “Saving Private Ryan” through the story and tone. Flawed, yet irresistible, “Fury” stands on a close line between flawed and brilliant.

    <a name="Frances Ha"></a>
    <h2>Frances Ha | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Frances Ha” is a lovely film, that is poignant, tender and beautiful. 
        With an astonishing performance from Greta Gerwig as Frances, and the outstanding supporting cast, “Frances Ha”  feels free to float itself in the urban dream, so vivid , yet colorless. 
        Noah Baumbach, seals the movie with moments of black and white splendor, across the screen. 
        Not many will be assured to fathom what goes on in the mind of either Frances  or the director, but will be assured a wonderful little ride of cinema. One of the best films of the year.

    <a name="Fruitvale Station"></a>
    <h2>Fruitvale Station | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Fruitvale Station” is a biographical film that follows the story of Oscar Grant (powerfully portrayed by Michael B. Jordan), whose tragic death lead to an uproar. 
        Wonderful ensemble of acting including Octavia Spencer as Oscar’s mom, uplifts the often emotional, and intense movie. 
        Slightly manipulative and unbalanced, “Fruitvale station” still manages to be gritty, compelling and unflinching. 
        Towards the finale, “Fruitvale Station” after all the tension built up, leaps into an powerful emotionally charged drama.

    <a name="Frozen"></a>
    <h2>Frozen | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Frozen” is a movie that you can call a typical Disney film, in a superlative way. It has an captivating appeal, and outstanding visuals. Moments like the ship carrying the sisters’ parents drowning synonymously with the music and the tad nicely twisted finale, makes “Frozen” better than most of the run-of-the-mill animated movies this year. Fantastically animated, beautifully scored, “Frozen” is a thoroughly enjoyable fun fare.
