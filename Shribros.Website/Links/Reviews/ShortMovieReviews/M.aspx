    <h2>Maleficent | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Maleficent” stands on Angelina Jolie’s shoulders. The re-telling of the classic “Sleeping Beauty” is assisted by some glittering special effects. The film is not completely gripping, yet is not shallow. As a fantasy, it still is a respectable film and is as much as it is fun as emotional. It is a darker tale, with all-round good performances ignited by the charisma of Jolie.

    <h2>Mud | 2012
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Mud” is a slow-burn coming-of-age southerner, that grasps the audience with its wide angled visuals and precise story-telling. The movie neither get carried away with less-ambitious violence not gets too sappy.  Jeff Nichols’ craftsmanship  along with strong performances from Matthew McConaughey and  Tye Sheridan. Lyrical, Sensitive, crisp and classy, “Mud” is a movie that even Mark Twain would’ve completely adored and cherished. This is classic American cinema.

    <h2>Mr.Peabody and Sherman | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mr. Peabody and Sherman has an unusually interesting story for a DreamWorks animation movie, reminding us of all the fun that a time travel movie can assure you. Funny, as it is thrilling, Mr. Peabody and Sherman, is delightful animation for a source material that is not of the present age. Clever and inventive throughout, this movie’s character sketch and text book notalgia, makes it a victory.

    <h2>Mundasupatti | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Following the most recent trend of making feature films from short ones or the script for short films, of the South Indian industry, “Mundasupatti” director Ramkumar offers the audience a feature length comedy, that is uneven, often funny and sometimes, pretty boring. With music helping the script, the movie features fresh story, though not long enough to occupy the length of the movie. Vishnu and Nandhita, alongside sidekicks, Kaali Venkat and Ramdoss , do their part to make the movie, that it is now. Funny and boring, the movie also injects anti-traditional motives.
