      <a name="Chef"></a>
    <h2>Chef | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Jon Favreau’s magic is all over chef. Witty, enjoyably clichéd, mouthwatering,feel-good, safe only for the good,  well-acted and written, “Chef” plays the audience with a breezy touch. With good supporting performances, this sweet little movie is convincingly deals with middle-age crisis.  A food-porn that is a treat to watch.

    <h2>Cold in July | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Jim Mickle’s “Cold in July” is an intelligent blend of Coen’s and Nicholas Winding Refn’s styles. Well-paced and shocking, it is also tense and twisty. Boasting tremendous performances the trio, Michael C. Hall, Don Johnson and Sam Sheperd, the movie just drives through its razor sharp script, alongside superb direction. The shock factor truly maintains the tempo and Mickle’s talent is something that we can look forward to.

    <a name="Captain Phillips"></a>
    <h2>Captain Phillips | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        “Captain Phillips” is exactly what Paul Greengrass is best at; Smart, Intense, shaky, powerful and edge of the seat thriller. 
        With him is Tom Hanks who portrays the title character with such ease and some tremendous acting. 
        With the true-to-life action sequences are un-showy and powerful, Greengrass drafts this biopic with care. 
        Nail-biting moments like the silence at the brink of the pirates boarding the ship after the tense period of the crew’s effort to stop the pirates make “Captain Phillips” unforgettable.

       <a name="Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2"></a>
    <h2>Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2| 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       Cloudy with a chance of meatballs 2 is possibly the most colorful film of the year. It is not as witty as its predecessor, but is an eye-popping, or rather lip-smacking treat for the viewers. With eco-friendly messages, neat storyline, this movie is not so remarkable, by any means, but a thoroughly entertaining experience.
