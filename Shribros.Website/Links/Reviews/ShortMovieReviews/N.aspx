    <h2>Noah | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
       Darren Aronofksy’s latest venture is the biblical epic of Noah’s story. Visually loaded with elements that vary from stop motion narrative of beginning of life , CGI form of thousands from the animal kingdom to nerve shattering moment of people fighting to eat the flesh of a goat alive, “Noah” succeeds in almost every aspect, except that it lack what Aronofsky’s movies are made of, the power of visionary emotion and intelligence.

    <a name="Nebraska"></a>
    <h2>Nebraska | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
       Hilarious, poignant, simple, poetic and moody, “Nebraska” is a brilliant film from the notable director, Alexander Payne. With a bleak black and white cinematography, the film stands out with low-key, but outstanding performance by Bruce Dern. This road movie doesn’t get too sentimental or philosophical, but is thought provoking as it is entertaining. One of the best films of the year.

     <a name="Naan"></a>
    <h2>Naan | 2012
    </h2>
    <p>
      “Naan” was a surprisingly exciting entertainer on identity theft,(inspired possibly by The Talented Mr.Ripley) helmed by Jeeva Shankar. Vijay Antony plays the lead actor and fittingly so. Not without its flaws, “Naan” makes an attempt to make the subject strong and thrilling. Most of the movie works and that can duly be attributed to the performances and the decent screenplay. Uneven, racy and stylish, “Naan” is worth a watch, once.
