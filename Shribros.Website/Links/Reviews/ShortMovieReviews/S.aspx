     <a name="Snowpiercer"></a>
    <h2>Snowpiercer | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Bong Joon-Ho, the Korean master film maker, lands into English language movies, with an exceptionally well fashioned, philosophically enriched, dystopian atmospheric film. The whole of the film happens in a train that pierces the snow in a futuristic world, where no life, exists outside the train. “Snowpiercer” is violent, brilliant, smart, savvy and weird. Unlike Bong Joon-Ho’s other movies, that are character driven and minimalistic, Snowpiercer, ponders more on the subject that it proposes. “Snowpiercer” is a film that plays as an action entertainer, as much as a metaphor to the whole world itself.

    <h2>Stoker | 2012
    </h2>
    <p>
        As any of Chan Woon Park’s films, “Stoker” is visually sumptuous, valiantly chilling and meritoriously character driven. 
        Although, the subject itself might seem a little bit weary, Park’s precise direction and sharp tone, lets it in the right route. 
        Startling cinematography and a systematic performance from Matthew Goode make “Stoker”, a movie that doesn’t disappoint on many levels. 
        Even, when it doesn’t stand up to the heights of the brilliant earlier movies of Park or the deft Vengeance trilogy, “Stoker”, devoid of the cheap thrills, stands rock-solid on its own grounds.

    <h2>Stranger by the lake | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Alain Guiraudie’s French movie “Stranger By the Lake” is an atmospheric erotic drama. Vitally, protagonist’s dilemma in choosing love beyond rectitude is dealt with ease. 
        Partly thrilling, straight forward cinematography and thoroughly captivating, “Stranger by the lake” is an unusually engaging murder mystery drama of sorts. 
        While, could have been a little bit more intense, the movie with its eerie but beautiful backdrop is a rewarding watch.

    <a name="Saving Mr.Banks"></a>
    <h2>Saving Mr.Banks | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        John Lee Hancock's “Saving Mr. Banks” is immediately admirable for a few things, astonishing performance by Emma Thompson, supported by the versatile, Tom Hanks, bright wits and the tragic history of P.L Travers. Sappy, but entertaining, “Saving Mr.Banks” is likeable, sugary and charming.  Whilst not magical as it might have been, Hancock manages to pull the best could.

    <a name="Shoot the Piano Player"></a>
    <h2>Shoot the Piano Player | 1960
    </h2>
    <p>
        Francois Truffaut’s improvisational “Shoot the Piano player” is a mixture of classy neo-realism and a little bit of dramatics. It is influential and a comprehensive fascinating study of human complex nature. While, one of the most sad movies of Truffaut, it is also one of his best. Charles Aznavour is fantastic as the shy piano player, who struggles to be all that he is. ”Shoot The Piano Player” is only Truffaut’s second feature, but is as bold as his “The 400 Blows”

     <a name="Short Term 12"></a>
    <h2>Short Term 12 | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        Destin Daniel Cretton’s short film to feature film adaptation “Short Term 12” is a compassionate drama, which has a clear heart and soul. It has a certain vision that is casually and inventively focused upon. The movie is very human and Brie Larson is fantastic in the lead role. Natural and superbly crafted, “Short Term 12” is a very good human drama that is compelling as it is realistic.

       <a name="Sathuranga Vettai"></a>
    <h2>Sathuranga Vettai | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        With no technical prominence and not-so-attractive cast, somehow “Sathuranga Vettai” succeeds, if not entirely. What could have been a bad movie, is pulled off by the director , H. Vinoth to a decorously watchable, socio-alert, well-casted film. The protagonist, Gandhi babu, played by Natraj Subramanian ,is a conman, who fiddles money from the public with his con-mind-games. Frequently self-aware, the movie entertains, though falters with its got-to-say dialogues. Watchable and surprising, “Sathuranga Vettai”, sticks to what it intends.
