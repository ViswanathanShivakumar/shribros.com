    <h2>Ida | 2014
    </h2>
    <p>
        Ida is a great film. Painted in a gray palette, the cinematography is versatile in every stunning frame. Observing, upsetting and shocking at the same time, “Ida” is a moody and smart piece of work from the Polish director, Pawel Pawlikowski. Delicately composed, evenly organized and is a spiritual meditation of the after math of the Nazi era, “Ida” is one of the very best films of the year.
