    <h2>12 Years a slave | 2013
    </h2>
    <p>
        British director Steve McQueen’s follow up to his marvelous feature line up including “Hunger” and “Shame”, 
        “12 years a slave” is a brutal, vital and intricate piece of work. While the viewing might be out of the comfort zone, 
        the lofty performances of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Lupita Nyong'o and Michael Fassbender do not let the audience take their eyes off the screen. 
        It is quite the brilliance of McQueen whose keen eye for historical truth and clever direction makes the film record history and makes it a brilliant and compulsory viewing.
