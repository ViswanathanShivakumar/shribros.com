        Often mentioned as “The Coen Brothers”, Joel Coen and
        Ethan Coen are very clever directors whose expressionism and unidentifiable artificial
        fabrication are drawn to an extent of film making, where the direction seems to
        be so perfect and so intelligent. Their unique style of film making makes them stand
        out of the crowd. The eccentricities and the extremes of the beautifully drawn characters
        move into the world of their movies, so very naturally and convincingly. That is
        the irony.

        “Blood Simple (1984)” is where it all began. The movie is the portrayal of
        darkness in human beings and the film itself characterizes it with maturity. Their
        movies have ethnographic implication and it was Texas in “Blood Simple”. The movie
        was also revelation of a new generation of directors. The gripping, at times darkly
        comic moments, formed the instinctive and austere note of the Coens. It is iconic
        film noir, gothic style especially the chilling climax. These brothers they don’t
        waste a shot. Their movies are firmly scripted and I have seen an exception till
        now.

        “Raising Arizona (1987)” was more of a comedy, unlike their debut feature.
        The scene as revealed in the title is Arizona. The movie engrosses us with the very
        archetypal direction of the Coens. It was a surprise for the brothers to follow
        their serious tone in “Blood Simple”, with a comedy. Sooner, it became a trend for
        them to mark the release of a grim themed movie followed by a comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
        Following “Raising Arizona”, the Hollywood filmdom saw the release of Coen’s classy
        “Miller’s Crossing (1990)”. The film is much more full-grown than both their
        preceding works. Set as a period piece, the intriguingly lit tone of the movie adds
        up to the towering tension all along the movie. It also became characteristic of
        Coens, to dig out a prevailing performance from their ensemble cast. There is an
        unhurried build up of the tension, sculpted scene over scene. “Miller’s crossing”
        was a thorough piece of directorial excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Barton Fink (1991)”, followed the double crossing drama. Featuring, an immense
        performance by John Turturro and John Goodman, the movie deals with the dreams and
        nightmarish actuality of the playwright. The Coen’s care for the script and the
        scrupulous consideration to their characters can be very well seen in “Barton Fink”.
        While the first half of the film revolves more around the playwright’s difficulty
        with writing, the latter is around the ghastly disclosure of the truth on his buddy.
        Every shot has an overcast undertone and the closing frame reveals an artistic legitimacy.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The Hudsucker Proxy (1994)”is perhaps the most criticized movie of the
        brothers. “The Hudsucker Proxy” is a comedy about a chap in search of job, who gets
        a work and fortunately/unfortunately gets into mess after the demise of his boss,
        Hudsucker. It was well made, but was also relatively an exception to the fashion
        of the brother’s films. Even when it is a memorable movie, it was slightly a plain
        sailing effort from the perfecto direction of the brothers.
    </p>
    <p>
        And then it is “Fargo (1996)”. The movie features Coens at their superlative
        effort of gifted script writing. Coens are so versatile with the film noirs. The
        movie grips you by neck and never leaves you till the finish. Yet again the darker
        face of the human nature is the area under discussion. Unquestionably one of the
        very finest works of Coen, Fargo has staggering performance by Frances McDormand.
        There is a lot of blood as in roughly any the wicked sibling’s works. It is such
        a straightforward story, intensely narrated. If somebody can do it this well, it’s
        only the brilliant Coens. Riveting!
    </p>
    <p>
        “The Big Lebowski (1998)” is another comedy classic by the duo. It replenishes the
        viewers with its attitude. The protagonist “The Dude” itself is clearly defined
        and vivid enough for the audience to feel the movie. The surreal sequences featured
        are one of the Coen’s coolest creations. Centering on the misapprehension and the
        consequences, the expressionist facade of the movie, quite literally bring to the
        fore, Coen’s funny side ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
        “O Brother, Where Art Thou? (2000)” is probably the beautifully cinematographed
        and toned movie of the Coens. The coalition of the murky area of the personality
        to the comical views of Coen-world is brought to us precisely. There is poignant
        music and so much to gaze at and experience, in this predominantly unique period
        comedy. The ensemble did a great job. Coens are also branded for the hiring a few
        actors continually and it has become a trademark as well.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The Man who wasn’t there (2001)” is photographed entirely in Black and White.
        Billy Bob Thronton plays the laconic barber in this noteworthy crime drama. It evidently
        portrays the unexciting routine life of the barber and his will to get out of that
        kind of existence. The movie has so much satire in it. The hilarity is obscured
        inside the observant happenings that have a lot of twists and sheer authenticity.
        As all other movies, “The Man who wasn’t there” is nothing short of the slow and
        focused narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Intolerable Cruelty (2003)” starring George Clooney and Catherine Zeta Jones,
        is again a very funny film. It is the tale of a Los Angeles divorce attorney, who
        messes his near great life, after meeting a woman. It’s not the greatest of Coen’s
        comedies but surely does make you sit right through the movie and offers plenty
        of fun and for a change it’s not very dark, but is there a Coen brother’s movie
        without sinister?
    </p>
    <p>
        The first remake that the Coens did was “The Lady Killers (2004)”, from the
        1955 movie of the same name. Starring Tom Hanks as the central character, the movie
        was perfectly derived into a resplendent Coen tasteful slapstick. Darkly funny and
        delightfully timed, the movie didn’t win every critic kindness. But the movie had
        the whole lot that we desired to see in a comedy by Coen.
    </p>
    <p>
        “No Country for Old Men (2007)”, when released became the most analyzed film
        of the decade. This gleaming, scoreless, dark, riveting, gruesome, uptight movie
        reflects the top notch directional skills of the duo brothers. The faithful adaptation
        of McCarthy’s novel, exceeds the prospect and bestows the audience, three stories
        interweaved in a fashion that it makes the spine chill. The film is filled with
        moments, where, we wouldn’t able to have power over our awe for the Coens. Easily,
        it is one of the (or the) best of the Coen Brothers. As one of the character says
        “Don't put it in your pocket, sir. Don't put it in your pocket. It's your lucky
        quarter. “, it was Coen’s lucky quarter. The wide-angle shots, the slow build of
        the tension enumerates the malevolence in human nature. A Masterpiece!
    </p>
    <p>
        Burn after Reading (2008)” is one of the darkest comedies, which the Coens
        ever did. You can call this a Coen special. The movie lives on satire. With exceptional
        cast performances, the movie triggers specialty laughs and surprises ever now and
        then. There is nil to question about the direction. It is Coen brother’s. Their
        mastery over the art, made the script look like a piece of cake for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        “A Serious Man (2009)” was more of a personal film to the Coens. It was all
        about the Jews and being good. The opening scene (the prologue) was iconic. The
        movie subtle touch on the heart of the every individual just proves the versatile
        nature of the Coen’s works. “.A Serious Man” works on various levels. The climax
        proves to be one of the very different and superior movie making. You can see the
        fully matured Coens at work.
    </p>
    <p>
        "True Grit (2010)" is the first real western , the Coens made. Although the
        movie doesn't sufficiently wear the Coenistic eccentricity, it does have their wacky
        humour and silent interludes; And of course, a pitch perfect direction. Boasting
        superb performance from the artistes, "True Grit" is Coen's revamping of the classic
        western feeling and how good it can be.
    </p>
    <p>
        Joel and Ethan Coen’s approach and style towards the film making makes them the
        auteur of the art. Loaded with highly effective screenplay and pitch perfect direction
        with the dark, sinister, baleful style of movies, they are nothing that you cannot
        rave about. We are just waiting for their next "Inside Llewyn Davis".We wouldn’t doubt their ability.
